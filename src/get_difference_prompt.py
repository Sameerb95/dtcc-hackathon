# def get_graph_prompt():
#     prompt = """**Objective:** You will be provided with two structured summaries, one from Version 1 and one from Version 2 of a document, corresponding to the same page or conceptual section. Your goal is to compare these two summaries, identify any differences in entities (nodes) or relationships (edges), and if differences exist, output a single JSON object detailing these changes. If there are no differences between the two provided summaries, you should output an empty JSON object `{{}}`.

#             summary_version_1
#             -----------------
#             {summary_v1}

#             summary_version_2
#             -----------------
#             {summary_v2}

#             **Input:**
#             You will receive two text inputs:
#             1.  `summary_v1`: A structured summary from Version 1 of the document.
#             2.  `summary_v2`: A structured summary from Version 2 of the document, corresponding to the same page/section as summary_v1.

#             Each summary (if not empty) will typically include:
#             *   Overall Summary
#             *   Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes) with descriptions.
#             *   Key Relationships/Interactions (Edges) with source, target, and nature of relationship.
#             *   Main Theme/Information Clusters.

#             **Instructions:**

#             1.  **Compare Summaries:** Carefully compare both the summaries.
#             2.  **Identify Differences:** Look for:
#                 *   Entities present in one version but not the other.
#                 *   Relationships present in one version but not the other.
#                 *   Changes in the description or attributes of common entities.
#                 *   Changes in the nature or attributes of common relationships.
#             3.  **Output JSON (Only if Differences Exist):**
#                 *   If and only if you find any differences, generate a single JSON object with two main keys: `"nodes_diff"` and `"edges_diff"`.
#                 *   If there are NO differences between them output an empty JSON object.

#             **JSON Structure (if differences exist):**

#             *   **`"nodes_diff"`**: (Object) Contains details about node differences.
#                 *   `"added_in_v2"`: (Array of Objects) Nodes present in `summary_v2` but not in `summary_v1`.
#                     *   Each object: `{{"label": "Node Label", "description": "Node Description from V2"}}`
#                 *   `"removed_from_v1"`: (Array of Objects) Nodes present in `summary_v1` but not in `summary_v2`.
#                     *   Each object: `{{"label": "Node Label", "description": "Node Description from V1"}}`
#                 *   `"modified"`: (Array of Objects) Nodes present in both but with changed attributes.
#                     *   Each object: `{{"label": "Common Node Label", "v1_description": "Desc in V1", "v2_description": "Desc in V2", "other_changed_attributes": {{"attr_name": {{"v1_value": "val1", "v2_value": "val2"}}}}}}` (other_changed_attributes is optional)

#             *   **`"edges_diff"`**: (Object) Contains details about edge differences.
#                 *   `"added_in_v2"`: (Array of Objects) Edges present in `summary_v2` but not in `summary_v1`.
#                     *   Each object: `{{"source_label": "Source Node Label", "target_label": "Target Node Label", "relationship_label": "Relationship Label from V2", "details": "Details from V2"}}`
#                 *   `"removed_from_v1"`: (Array of Objects) Edges present in `summary_v1` but not in `summary_v2`.
#                     *   Each object: `{{"source_label": "Source Node Label", "target_label": "Target Node Label", "relationship_label": "Relationship Label from V1", "details": "Details from V1"}}`
#                 *   `"modified"`: (Array of Objects) Edges between the same entities but with changed relationship label or details.
#                     *   Each object: `{{"source_label": "Source Node Label", "target_label": "Target Node Label", "v1_relationship_label": "Rel Label V1", "v2_relationship_label": "Rel Label V2", "v1_details": "Details V1", "v2_details": "Details V2"}}`

#             **CRITICAL: The entire response must be ONLY the JSON object (or `{{}}` if no differences). Ensure it is complete, valid, and not truncated. Do not include any explanatory text.**
