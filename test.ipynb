All the reports submitted by the counterparties to the TRs after the start of reporting \\nunder the RTS and ITS on reporting  will have to comply with the amended \\nrequirements. This applies to  the reports of derivatives concluded after the reporting \\nstart dat e and to  any modifications or terminations reported after that date, \\nirrespective of when the derivative that is modified or terminated was concluded.  \\n6. In general, a ny reportable lifecycle event will need to be reported in line with the \\nrevised requirements . \\n7. In accordance with the Article 10(2) of the ITS on reporting, the counterparties \\nshould update all their outstanding derivatives to conform with the revised reporting \\nrequirements within 180 calendar days of the reporting start date by submitting a \\nrepor t with event type ‘Update’, unless they have submitted a report with the action \\ntype ‘Modify’ or ‘Correct’ (correcting the details of the trade11) for such derivatives \\nwithin this period  (given that ‘Modify’ and ‘Correct’ will be full messages, thus \\nreport ing of a modification or a correction of the derivative will require provision of \\nall relevant details of that derivative).  \\n8. If the counterparty does not report within the 180 -day transition period any \\nmodification or any correction of the derivative, it s hould submit a report using \\ncombination of action type ‘Modify’ and event type ‘Update’, populating all the \\nrelevant details in accordance with the RTS and ITS on reporting.  \\n9. Even if a counterparty reports daily collateral and valuation updates, but no \\nmodification or correction was reported during transition period for a given \\nderivative, the counterparty should update that derivative .  \\n10. If the derivative matures or is terminated during the transition period, counterparties \\ndo not need to send the report wi th event  type ‘Update’ when no reportable \\nmodification took place.  \\n11. All outstanding derivatives, both at a trade and at a position level, should be \\nupdated. The derivatives at trade level that were included in a position are not \\noutstanding and therefore sh ould not be updated. Only the corresponding \\nderivative at position level should be updated, to the extent it is outstanding on the \\nreporting start date.  \\n12. Terminated or matured trades should not be updated and re -reported. This is \\nwithout prejudice to send ing reports  such as modifications and corrections  with \\nregards to past events for terminated or matured trades , where relevant.  \\n \\n11 Action type ‘Correct’ will allow for correcting trade data or trade and valuation data or margin data. Only the report with action \\ntype ‘Correct’ related to trade data or trade and valuation data  will ensure update of all relevant fields of a derivative.

In general, a ny reportable lifecycle event will need to be reported in line with the \\nrevised requirements . \\n7. In accordance with the Article 10(2) of the ITS on reporting, the counterparties \\nshould update all their outstanding derivatives to conform with the revised reporting \\nrequirements within 180 calendar days of the reporting start date by submitting a \\nrepor t with event type ‘Update’, unless they have submitted a report with the action \\ntype ‘Modify’ or ‘Correct’ (correcting the details of the trade11) for such derivatives \\nwithin this period  (given that ‘Modify’ and ‘Correct’ will be full messages, thus \\nreport ing of a modification or a correction of the derivative will require provision of \\nall relevant details of that derivative).  \\n8.

Even if a counterparty reports daily collateral and valuation updates, but no \\nmodification or correction was reported during transition period for a given \\nderivative, the counterparty should update that derivative .  \\n10. If the derivative matures or is terminated during the transition period, counterparties \\ndo not need to send the report wi th event  type ‘Update’ when no reportable \\nmodification took place.  \\n11. All outstanding derivatives, both at a trade and at a position level, should be \\nupdated. The derivatives at trade level that were included in a position are not \\noutstanding and therefore sh ould not be updated. Only the corresponding \\nderivative at position level should be updated, to the extent it is outstanding on the \\nreporting start date.  \\n12. Terminated or matured trades should not be updated and re -reported. This is \\nwithout prejudice to send ing reports  such as modifications and corrections  with \\nregards to past events for terminated or matured trades , where relevant.  \\n \\n11 Action type ‘Correct’ will allow for correcting trade data or trade and valuation data or margin data. Only the report with action \\ntype ‘Correct’ related to trade data or trade and valuation data  will ensure update of all relevant fields of a derivative. Valuation \\nand margin data will be updated in any case by sending the daily valuation and margins reports (action types ‘Valuation’ and \\n‘Margin update’, respectively)  \\n \\n \\n \\n12 \\n13. If a counterparty reopens a not -updated derivative with action type ‘Revive’, either \\nduring the transition period or afterwards, i t should provide all relevant details of the \\nderivative as of the date of the revival , as in any other ‘Revive’ report.  \\n14. The transition period does not impact in any way the obligation under Article 9 of \\nEMIR to report the relevant events by T+1 . Therefore any conclusion, modification \\nor termination of a derivative occurring after the reporting start date, should be \\nreported accordingly by the end of the next working day (T+1), also if it occurs \\nduring the 6 -month transition period.  \\n15. During the tr ansition period TRs should include all outstanding derivatives in the \\nreconciliation process, irrespective of whether they have been updated or not.  The \\nfields required under the RTS and ITS on reporting  will be  subject to reconciliation  \\nas specified in th e Annex to the RTS on data quality . Fields that were reported in \\nthe past but are no longer required under the RTS and ITS on reporting  will not be \\nreconciled.  \\n16. The counterparties should not create a new UTI for outstanding derivatives, even if \\nthe original  UTI is not fully compliant with the new format requirements under the \\nRTS and ITS on reporting . This applies also to field 2.3 ‘Prior UTI ’ and field 2.4 \\n‘Subsequent position UTI ’. \\n17. In line with the EMIR  validation rules TRs should not reject reports due to  UTIs that \\nare not fully compliant with the new requirements for those derivatives that were \\nconcluded before the reporting start date of the RTS and ITS on reporting .  \\n18. In case of transfer of data between TRs, prior to the data transfer TRs should \\nensure t hat TR participants upgrade the outstanding derivatives that are subject to \\ndata transfer to the most up to date reporting requirement12. \\n3.2 Determining the number of reportable derivatives  \\n3.2.1  Reportable products  \\n19. EMIR Article 9(1) states that “counterparties and CCPs shall ensure that the details \\nof any derivative contract they have concluded and of any modification or \\ntermination of the contract are reported  to a trade repository […]”. A derivative \\ncontract or derivative is defined in EMIR Art icle 2(5) as a financial instrument as set \\nout in points (4) to (10) of Section C of Annex I to MiFID. In the last few years \\nseveral uncertainties have been raised with regards to the qualification of certain \\ncontracts  as derivatives . This section aims to provide clarification to market \\nparticipants taking into account the current state of the regulations.  \\nCurrency derivatives  \\n \\n12 See Guideline 11 in the ESMA74 -362-2351 Guidelines on transfer of data between Trade Reposi tories under EMIR and SFTR  \\n \\n \\n \\n13 \\n20. MIFID RTS on organisation al requirements  for investment firms13 clarifies in Article \\n10 the characteristics of other derivative cont racts relating to currencies which \\nallows to differentiate between spot contracts that are not derivatives and forward \\ncontracts that are derivative contracts. In principle, and more particularly for major \\ncurrency pairs, a FX contract  is considered a deri vative if the delivery is scheduled \\nto be made at least 3 trading days after the execution of the contract, while under \\nsome circumstances this limit may be extended based on standard market \\npractices. Based on the above elements, forward FX contracts are reportable under \\nEMIR while spot FX contracts  are not.  \\n21. As an illustration a FX contract  selling X EUR and purchasing Y USD traded on \\nMonday 4  January 2021 and settling on Thursday 7 January 2021 is a forward \\ncontract and reportable under EMIR. A similar FX  contract  traded on Monday 4 \\nJanuary 2021 and settling on Wednesday 6 January 2021 is a spot contract and \\nnot reportable under EMIR.  \\n22. A FX contracts  selling X EUR and purchasing Z ZAR traded on Monday 4 January \\n2021 and settling on Wednesday 6 January 2021,  for which the transaction is \\ncarried out in order to purchase an equity traded on the JSE14 with a T+3 settlement \\ncycle is not a derivative and thus not subject to reporting under EMIR based on the \\nfact that when a FX contract  is linked to the purchase of  transferable securities or \\nunits of collective investment undertaking, it is considered as a derivative when the \\ndelivery is made after the delivery period of the market where the transferable \\nsecurities or units in an  undertaking for collective investmen t in transferable \\nsecurities (UCIT S) are traded or after 5 days, whichever is the shorter.  \\n23. Furthermore, Article 10  provides that “a  contract shall not be considered a spot \\ncontract where, irrespective of its explicit terms, there is an understanding between \\nthe parties to the contract that delivery of the underlying is to be postponed and not \\nto be performed within ” the period referre d to in the above paragraphs.  \\n24. For swaps, at first cross currency swaps and FX swaps are to be distinguished. \\nCross currency swaps are contract s that  contain both an interest rate factor and a \\ncurrency factor . They are  considered as interest rate derivative s and should be \\nreported as such  under EMIR . FX swaps to the contrary only entail a FX factor (i.e. \\nin general no interim payments occur). FX swap  is a derivative  composed of 2 legs, \\na near leg and a far leg. Regardless of  whether the near leg is a spot or  a forward, \\nthe FX swap should be reported as a single derivative  rather than as a combination \\nof derivatives . Further details on how these derivatives should be reported are \\ncontained in section  4.4. \\nDerivatives on crypto -assets  \\n25. Only derivatives on crypto -assets that fulfil the definition of ‘derivative ’ or ‘derivative \\ncontract ’ under EMIR  are expected to be reported.  \\n \\n13 Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2017/565 of 25 April 2016 supplementing Directive 2014/65/EU of the European \\nParliament and of the Council as regards organisational requirements and opera ting conditions for investment firms and defined \\nterms for the purposes of that Directive (Text with EEA relevance)  \\n14 Equity Market Risk Management | Johannesburg Stock Exc hange (jse.co.za)\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

For the reporting of the details of derivatives, counterparties should  rely on the \\nregulatory framework that is applicable. Therefore, if the derivative on a \\ncrypto -asset is considered as a financial instrument under MiFID, it should be \\nreported in accorda nce with its features.  \\n27. In case where a counterparty enters a derivative contract with a crypto -asset as the \\nunderlying,  it should populate  the field 2.12 ’Derivative based on crypto -assets ‘ with \\n’True’. \\nTotal return swaps, liquidity swaps or collateral sw aps ( in relation to  SFTR)  \\n28. Some obligations related to total return swaps (TRS) are included in SFTR, notably \\nin Chapter IV relating to Transparency towards investors. Nevertheless, TRS are \\nderivatives and thus are reportable under EMIR and not under SFTR. The definition \\nin Article 3(18) of SFTR clearly states that a TRS “means a derivative contract as \\ndefined in point (7) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 in which one \\ncounterparty transfers the total economic performance, including income from \\ninterest and fees, gains and losses from price movements, and credit losses, of a \\nreference obligation to another counterparty.” It is to be noted that depending on \\nthe underlying, TRS are to be reported either as credit  derivatives or as equity \\nderivatives. Details on how these are to be reported can be found in sections  4.7 \\nand 4.8. \\n29. Furthermore , Recital 7 of SFTR clarifies  that some transactions that are commonly \\nreferred to as liquidity swaps and collateral swaps, which do not fall under the \\ndefinition of ’derivative co ntracts ‘ under EMIR, are included in the scope of SFTR. \\nThese  contract s are  not reportable under EMIR.  \\nComplex contracts  \\n30. In the case of contracts stemming from another contract (e.g. option on a future), \\nthe first contract ceases to exist before giving ris e to the second one which is \\nmaterially different from the first one. The two contracts should be reported \\nseparately , i.e. the second one should only be reported once the first contract is \\nterminated. Therefore, even though the two contracts are connected  in the way they \\ncome into existence, they should be reported in two separate reports. In case where \\nthe resulting contract does not quali fy as a ‘derivative ’ or ‘derivative contract’  as \\ndefined in EMIR Article 2(5), the resulting contract should  not be re ported.  \\n31. In the case where a derivative has two or more legs (e.g. a single derivative contract \\nrepresenting a strategy that has the features of several contracts), all legs of the \\ncontract should be reported in one report, where the combination of fields allows \\nfor this. Otherwise, a report per leg should be submitted  and those reports should \\nbe linked by using the same package identifier in field 2.6 .  \\nMarket transactions that do not fall under the definition of a derivative  \\n32. The following transactions do not fall under the definition of a derivative  under EMIR  \\nand thus should not be reported under EMIR:  \\n \\n \\n \\n15 \\na. Financial instruments with embedded derivatives (e.g. convertible bonds): some \\nfinancial instruments are issued with features that could be  considered as \\nderivatives embedded in the structure of the instrument itself. This is for \\ninstance the case of convertible bonds which according to Table 2.2 of Annex \\nIII of RTS 2017/583 “means an instrument consisting of a bond or a securitised \\ndebt inst rument with an embedded derivative, such as an option to buy the \\nunderlying equity”.  \\nb. Structured finance products or structured products are defined in Article \\n2(1)(28) of MiFIR as “those securities created to securitise and transfer credit \\nrisk associated  with a pool of financial assets entitling the security holder to \\nreceive regular payments that depend on the cash flow from the underlying \\nassets”.  \\nc. Securitised derivatives are defined in Table 4.1 of Annex of RTS 2017/583 as \\n“a transferable security as de fined in Article 4(1)(44)(c) of Directive 2014/65/EU \\ndifferent from structured finance products”. These include at least:  \\n• plain vanilla covered warrants;  \\n• leverage certificates;  \\n• exotic covered warrants;  \\n• negotiable rights;  \\n• investment certificates.  \\n3.2.2  Reporting obligation with regards to the parties involved in the trade  \\n33. Intragroup derivatives , not eligible for exemption, sh ould be reported as any other \\nderivatives and the corresponding field 2.37 ’Intragroup ‘ should be populated as \\n’True‘. However, Article 9(1) EMIR provides for a n exemption of intragroup \\nderivatives  from the reporting obligation  where the relevant conditions are met . In \\nthese cases, both counterparties should continue to report until the conditions for \\napplying the exempt ion can be met and the exemption is granted  (further \\nclarifications on the exemption are provided in the section 3.3).  \\n34. Derivatives  within the same legal entity (e.g. between two desks or between two \\nbranches of the same entity) should not be reported under EMIR as they do not \\ninvolve two counterparties. The only exception is the situation in which a Clearing \\nMember defaults and the CCP temporarily assumes both sides of the outstanding \\nderivative contracts.  \\n35. Similarly, non -EU subsidiaries  of a group for which the parent undert aking is \\nestablished in the Union  are not required to report  their derivatives under EMIR . In \\nthe case of contracts between a n EU counterparty and a non -EU counterparty, the \\nEU counterparty will need to report such contracts . \\n36. EMIR requires counterparties and CCPs to report. CCPs are define d in EMIR \\nArticle 2(1) and counterparties are defined either as FC if the entity  falls under  any \\nof the categories of financial counterparties defined in EMIR or as an NFC if it is an\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

The concept of an \\nundertaking is not defined in EMIR. However, t he European Commission provides \\nin its FAQ15, question II.14 a rationale leading to the consideration that the  “concept \\nof undert aking is broader than that of \\'companies or firms\\' and thus, is not restricted \\nto entities with legal personality or with for -profit -making (Article 54 TFEU) ”. It is \\nworth noting that individuals not carrying out an economic activity are consequently \\nnot c onsidered as undertakings and  thus are not subject to the reporting obligation \\nunder EMIR.  \\n37. As a consequence, if the activity performed by the entity with a charitable nature or \\notherwise a non -profit profile falls under the definition of an economic activi ty that \\nqualifies it as a charity or non -profit entity, it would be subject to the obligations \\napplicable to non -financial counterparties for the derivatives concluded, including \\nthe reporting obligation.  \\n38. With regards to investment funds (e.g. UCITS, AIF, unincorporated funds, IORP), \\nthe counterparty to the derivative is generally the fund (or in case of umbrella funds, \\nthe sub -fund). When a fund manager executes a contract  for different funds at the \\nsame time (e.g. block trade), it should immediately alloc ate the relevant part of that \\ncontract  to the relevant funds and report accordingly. As a consequence, the \\ncounterparty ID should be the ID of the fund, not the ID of the fund manager. \\nAccording to Articles 9(1b) to (1d) EMIR, the fund manager shall report  the OTC \\nderivatives on behalf of the funds. The ID of the fund manager should be included \\nas the entity responsible for reporting and where it reports directly as the report \\nsubmitting entity.  It should be noted that in rare circumstances, the fund manage r \\nexecutes trades on its own account and not on behalf of the funds it manages . In \\nsuch  case the counterparty would be the fund manager.  \\n39. Non-EU AIFs that are set up exclusively for the purpose of serving one or more \\nemployee share purchase plans, or that a re securitisation special purpose entities \\nas referred to in point (g) of Article  2(3) of Directive  2011/61/EU, do not qualify \\neither as FC s under Article 2 (8) nor as NFC s under Article 2(9). As such, these \\nAIFs are not subject to the reporting obligation and therefore, they should not report \\nderivatives under EMIR.  However, if the other counterparty is subject to  the \\nreporting obligation under EMIR, that counterparty should report deriva tives \\nconcluded with such non -EU AIFs.  \\n40. More generally , with regards to funds and in particular when an AIFM is managing \\nAIFs domiciled in the Union and AIFs domiciled in third countries, fund manager \\nshould  establish whether the AIF qualifies as a FC under  EMIR Article 2(8). In case \\nthe AIF qualifies as a FC, the AIFM that is authorised or registered under AIFMD \\nshould  ensure that the derivative  details are reported . \\n41. Finally , some specific entities are out of scope of EMIR in general in accordance \\nwith EMIR  Article 1(4) such as the BIS, central banks or public bodies charged with \\nor intervening in the management of the public debt for a given list of countries. \\nHowever , with regard to Article 1(5) the reporting obligation is the only EMIR \\n \\n15 emir-faqs-10072014_en.pdf (europa.eu) . \\n \\n \\n \\n17 \\nobligation that app lies to multilateral development banks, some public sector \\nentities, the ESF and ESM.  \\n42. Investment firms that provide investment services ( such as  execution of orders or \\nreceipt and transmission of orders) without becoming  a counterparty to a derivative \\nby acting as principal do not have an obligation to report under EMIR. Nevertheless, \\nin case the investment firm acts as an investment fund manager as described in \\nparagraphs 1b, 1c or 1d of EMIR Article 9, then this investment firm becomes \\nresponsible and leg ally liable to report on behalf of the counterparty and to report \\nits own LEI in the field 1.3 ‘Entity responsible for reporting ’.  \\n43. Similarly, when a management company provides the service of portfolio \\nmanagement (as defined in Article 4(8) of MiFID) to a client, and, by doing so, \\nenters into derivative contracts, the client should be considered as the counterparty \\nto the derivative, except when the management company bears the risk of the \\nderivative contract and therefore is considered  as a counterparty. The management \\ncompany can report to TRs on behalf of its clients without prejudice to the client’s \\nliability for meeting the reporting obligation. In that situation, the ID of the \\nmanagement company should  be provided as the report submitting e ntity ID.  \\n44. When a broker is a counterparty to a derivative , it should report the derivative and \\nidentify itself  as a counterparty. In line with the RTS on reporting  and more \\nparticularly with regard to the details to be reported in the field 1.15, the broke r is \\nthen not required to report its LEI in the field ’Broker ID ’ Otherwise , if a broker only \\nacts as an intermediary for counterparty 1, the LEI of the broker should  be reported \\nin the ‘Broker ID ’ field.  \\n3.2.3  Reportability in specific scenarios  \\n45. Reporting under  EMIR is dual -sided , i.e. both counterparties to derivative contracts \\nare required to report if they fall under the scope of EMIR. As a consequence,  for a \\nderivative entered into by two counterparties subject to EMIR, the same derivative \\nis expected to be reported twice, once on behalf of each counterparty , and the \\ndetails of the reported derivative  should be consistent across both reports.  \\n46. Article 9(1e) stipulates that counterparties and CCPs should ensure that such \\ndetails are reported cor rectly and without duplication. Based on this requirement, \\ncounterparties or other entities responsible for reporting should put in place \\nprocesses and controls in order to avoid the risk of duplicate reporting. This is \\nparticularly important (i) in the ca se of a change of TR (ensure that the reports are \\nchannelled to the right TR), (ii) in the case of a corporate event such as a merger \\nor an acquisition (avoid reporting the same derivative  on behalf of the wrong entity) \\nor (iii) in the case of changes in d elegation (ensure that only one delegate d entity  \\nreports a derivative ). In case a duplicate report is identified the counterparty should \\nimmediately take corrective actions with diligence in order to resolve the problem.  \\n47. In the event of a novation , where a  counterparty (being a CCP or another \\ncounterparty) steps into a derivative and becomes a new counterparty to the \\nderivative  (this paragraph does not cover clearing events) , the derivative  should be \\nreported with action type ‘New’ and event type ‘Step-in’ by both counterparties , i.e.\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

For block trades, there is a distinction necessary between (i) scenarios where the \\nblock trade was concluded by an investment firm and then allocated to clients and \\n(ii) those scenar ios where the block trade was concluded by a fund manager without \\nown reporting obligation and then allocated to individual funds.  \\n49. In the first case the block trade should first be reported by the investment firm. The \\ninvestment firm should then report th e allocations to the individual clients.  \\n50. In the second case, block trades that are subsequently allocated to individual funds \\non trade date are not required to be reported. In such cases, the counterparty to \\nthe derivative  is the individual fund, therefor e the allocations should be reported (a) \\nspecifying the relevant individual fund (on behalf of which the fund manager has \\nentered into the block trade) as counterparty to the said trade and (b) specifying the \\nallocation of the relevant part of the trade to  the relevant individual fund. Any parts \\nof a block trade that are not allocated on trade date should be reported with the \\nfund manager as the counterparty. This reporting logic would only apply where the \\nallocation post trade date is permitted by the appl icable national legislation.  \\n51. In case a collateral agreement allows the covering of exposures in transactions that \\nare not to be reported under EMIR, the collateral reported should be just the \\ncollateral that covers the exposure related to the derivatives r eported  under EMIR. \\nIf it is impossible to distinguish within a pool of collateral the amount which relates \\nto derivatives reportable under EMIR from the amount which relates to other \\ntransactions , the collateral reported can reflect  the actual collateral posted / \\nreceived covering a wider set of transactions. As a consequence, in case none of \\nthe transactions covered by the report is reportable under EMIR, no collateral \\nshould be reported.  \\n52. Regulation (EU) 2019/834 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May \\n2019 amending Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 removed the backloading \\nrequirement from Article 9 of EMIR, therefore derivatives  concluded before and no \\nlonger outstanding on 12 Feb ruary 2014 are not subject to the reporting obligation.  \\n53. Where no contracts are concluded, modified or terminated during several days, no \\nreports are expected apart from updates to valuations or collateral on outstanding \\nderivative s, as required. As the obl igation to report should be complied with by T+1 \\n(T being the date of conclusion/modification/termination of the contract), there is no \\nother need to send daily reports if there are no conclusion, modifications to the \\ncontract or termination.  \\n54. Derivatives that are concluded and then  netted or terminated for other reasons \\nduring the same day, should be reported to TRs. In case of a termination during the \\nsame day, at least two reports should be sent: a report with action type ‘New’ and \\na second report with  action type ‘Terminate’ and the relevant  event type, unless the \\nderivative is reported with action type ‘Position component’ in which case it will be \\n \\n \\n \\n19 \\nnette d into the subsequent position  (please refer to section  3.7 for position level \\nreporting specificities ).  \\n55. With regards to cleared derivatives , the Article 2 of the RTS on reporting  details \\nhow trades that are cleared should be reported. As a conseque nce, if the derivative \\nis not cleared on the same day by a CCP or if the derivative  is concluded off venue, \\nthe derivative  should first be reported in its original state and then, once it is cleared, \\nthe original derivative  should be terminated with  action type ‘Terminate’ and  event \\ntype ‘Clearing ’. The subsequent derivative  should be reported with action type \\n‘New’ and event type ‘C learing’  or, if relevant , with action type  ‘Position \\nComponent ’.  \\n \\n3.3 Intragroup exemption from reporting  \\n56. The three -month period referred to in Article 9(1) EMIR, as amended by Regulation \\n2019/834, in which  the authorities may disagree with the fulfilment of the above \\nconditions, starts on the calendar day following receipt of the notification(s) by the \\nrelevant NCA(s).  \\n57. The exemption should be valid from the date when the NCA(s) confirm(s) to the \\ncounterparty(ies) that the conditions to use the exemption are s atisfied, or if no \\ndecision is notified by the NCA(s), it will be valid from the end of the three -month \\nnon-objection period. If the conditions, referred to in the third sub -paragraph of \\nArticle 9(1) EMIR, as amended by Regulation 2019/834,  may be no longe r fulfilled \\ndue to a  change  in the counterparties characteristics , the counterparties need to \\ninform the relevant NCA (s). Without prejudice to the existing exemption, the NCA(s) \\ncan object to the use of the exemption if the conditions  are no longer met . From th e \\npoint in time  at which the NCA objects to the u se of the exemption  the exemption \\nwill not be valid.  \\n58. It should be noted that the counterparties should  report derivatives during the three -\\nmonth period unless the NCA(s) notify(ies ) the counterparty(ies) that they agree \\nupon fulfilment of the conditions before the three -month period expires.  \\n59. With regards to the reference to the ‘parent undertaking’ for the purpose of the \\nconditions for the exemption under Article 9(1) EMIR, as amend ed by Regulation \\n2019/834, it should be considered that:  \\na) the ultimate parent undertaking of the group16 relevant for the consolidation on a full \\nbasis is the parent undertaking for that purpose, and  \\nb) the centralised risk evaluation, measurements and contro l procedures should  be \\napplicable for the counterparties notifying the exemption from reporting. It is not \\n \\n16 The European Commission has clarified tha t the exemption contained in Article 9(1) of EMIR does not cover intragroup \\ntransactions for which the parent undertaking is established in a third country, even if the transaction occurs between two \\ncounterparties which are both established in the EU. (se e ESMA EMIR Q&A TR Answer 51 (m).)  \\n \\n \\n \\n20 \\nnecessary that they are established at the level of the whole group of the ultimate \\nundertaking.  \\nThe notion of ultimate parent undertaking under poin t a) here above is to be \\nunderstood as the highest consolidating entity in the group.   \\n \\n \\n \\n21 \\n60.

It is not necessary that the ultimate parent undertaking or \\nthe entity relevant for centralised risk evaluation, measurements and control \\nprocedures with regards to the counterparties for which the exemption is notified , \\nis a counterparty to a derivative contract, neither that it is located in the Member \\nState  where it submits a notification.  \\n63. When notifying of their intention to apply the exemption from the reporting obligation \\nin accordance with Article 9(1) EMIR , the not ifying counterparty should state that it \\nfulfils the conditions laid down in the third subparagraph of Article 9(1) EMIR and, \\nif applicable, should indicate the other NCA(s) that have been notified with regards \\nto the counterparty(ies) included in the noti fication. The NCA may ask for additional \\ninformation and/or documents to assess the fulfilment of the conditions laid down \\nin the third subparagraph of Article 9(1) EMIR.  \\n64. Counterparties may notify their intention to apply an intragroup exemption even if \\nthe counterparties have not yet concluded any derivative s and consequently apply \\nthe exemption unless one of the NCAs objects for derivatives concluded after the \\nexemption has been granted. Nevertheless, the notification should  only be \\nsubmitted once all the  conditions specified in third sub -paragraph of Article 9(1) of \\nEMIR are fulfilled.  \\n65. When counterparties of the same group established in at least two different Member \\nStates  notify their NCAs of their intention to apply a reporting exemption under \\nArticle  9(1) EMIR , each NCA needs to consider whether the conditions laid down \\nin the third subparagraph of Article 9(1) are met. NCAs may disagree on the \\nfulfilment of these conditions. Where one of the NCAs considers that the conditions \\nare not fulfilled, it sh ould notify the counterparty in its Member State  as well as the \\nother NCA(s) within the three -month period of the receipt of the notification and \\nspecify the reasons.  \\n66. Where counterparties want to benefit from the exemption from reporting and once \\nthey cons ider they have addressed the objection(s) raised by the objecting NCA(s),  \\nthey should renotify accordingly of their intention to apply the reporting exemption \\nunder Article 9(1) EMIR.   \\n67. A derivative contract between a financial counterparty (FC) and non -financial \\ncounterparty (NFC) where:  \\na. the FC belongs to both a group of undertakings referred to in Article 3(1) or \\nArticle 80(7) and (8) of Directive 2006/48/EC (CRD), and another group referred \\nto in Articles 1 and 2 of Directive 83/349/EEC, and  \\nb. the NFC me rely belongs to the group under Articles 1 and 2 of Directive \\n83/349/EEC,  \\n \\n \\n \\n25 \\nc. may be eligible for an intragroup exemption from reporting. Notably, in \\naccordance with the definition of ‘group’ in Article 2(16) EMIR, as amended by \\nRegulation 2019/834, such a co ntract may be eligible for an intragroup reporting \\nexemption if the NFC, while not consolidated under the CRD, is part of the same \\nconsolidated non -financial group as the FC.  \\n68. For the avoidance of doubt, if counterparties notify their respective NCAs on \\ndifferent dates, they should wait until the end of the later of the two three -month \\nperiods before relying on the exemption (provided neither NCA objected) or until all \\nrelevant NCAs agree on the fact that the conditions laid down in the third \\nsubparagraph of  Article 9(1) EMIR are met. The reporting exemption for the \\nderivative contracts concluded by the relevant counterparties is not valid, if one \\nNCA has objected to it. Therefore, the derivatives concluded between the \\ncounterparties, that are included in the  notification, should continue to be reported.  \\n69. Once the reporting exemption is valid, the counterparties that benefit from the \\nexemption should send reports with action type ‘Error’ for all the derivative s referred \\nto in paragraphs 2(a) and 2(b) of Article  2 of the ITS  on reporting  with the \\ncounterparties for which the reporting exemption is valid.  \\n70. If the reporting exemption ceased to be valid due to a non -compliance with any of \\nthe conditions referred to in the third sub -paragraph of Article 9(1) EMIR , the \\ncounterparties concerned should report the derivative contracts that have been \\nconcluded and have not been terminated by the counterparties nor matured on the \\ndate the exemption ceased to be valid using action type ‘New’ and event type \\n‘Trade’ and provide  all the relevant details of those derivatives as they stand on the \\ndate when the exemption ceases to be valid, and report all subsequent lifecycle \\nevents as they occur. It is not necessary to report the lifecycle events  to the \\nderivative that occurred bet ween the date of conclusion of that derivative and the \\ndate when the exemption ceased to be valid. If the se derivatives were previously \\ncancelled with action type ‘Error’ at the moment when the exemption was granted, \\nthe counterparties should report such d erivatives with action type Revive . Also in \\nthis scenario, it is not necessary to report lifecycle events that occurred  during the \\nperiod when the ex emption from reporting was valid.   \\n3.4 Allocation of responsibility for reporting  \\n3.4.1  General clarifications  \\n71. In accordance with EMIR Article 9(1), counterparties and CCPs are required to \\nensure that the details of any derivative that is reportable as described in the section \\n3.2 are reported to a TR. Therefore, unless an exemption applies or unless a \\ndifferent party is responsible and legally liable for reporting pursuant to Article 9(1a) \\nof EMIR, the reporting obligations apply to all counterparties and CCPs e stablished \\nin the Union  as soon as they enter into a derivative contract. This means, that  such  \\na derivative should be reported no later than the working day following its \\nconclusion , modification or termination .  \\n \\n \\n \\n26 \\n3.4.2  FC trading with NFC  \\n72. With regard to the pro visions under Article 9(2) of the ITS on reporting , ESMA \\nconsiders that, in order to fulfil the respective requirements , NFC- and FC should \\nagree on the way to exchange information in each of these cases. More particularly, \\nwith regard to Article 9(2) (a) of the ITS on reporting , those arrangements should \\nallow the FC to have the information no later than T+1 after the conclusion or \\nmodification of a contract so that the FC can proceed to the timely reporting. This \\ncan be achieved e.g. by providing a list of  predefined standard values to be used \\nas default by the FC, unless specified otherwise by the NFC -. In any case the NFC - \\nremains responsible for providing the FC with correct details and the FC is \\nresponsible for using  the information provided by the NFC -. As an example of \\npredefined values, consider the case where an NFC - is entering into derivative \\ncontracts with a credit institution without the use of a broker, not clearing those \\ncontracts and entering into the m only to hedge its commercial activity in the sense \\nof EMIR Article 10(3). In this case, the NFC - could agree that the FC reports the \\nbelow pre -defined values in the fields specified in Article 9(2) of the ITS on \\nreporting,  unless the NFC - specifically instructs the FC otherwise:  \\na. 1.15 ‘Broker ID ’: blank.  \\nb. 1.16 ‘Clearing Member ’: blank.  \\nc. 1.20 ‘Directly linked to commercial activity or treasury financing ’: ‘True’. \\n73. ESMA takes this opportunity to remind market participants that NFC - are not \\nrequired to report data on collateral, mark -to-market, or mark -to-model valuations \\nof the contracts in accordance with Article 4 of the RTS on reporting. Nevertheless, \\nshould the FC report this information, it should be correct as of the respective \\ncollateral or valuation timestamp.  \\n74. A particular situation is where a conclusion of a derivative has been reported or \\nshould have been reported by the NFC - (either because it was executed before the \\nprovisions setting out the reporting responsib ility became applicable on 18 June \\n2020 or because the NFC - opted -out at the time of the execution), and a \\nmodification or termination is to be reported under the provisions assigning the \\nresponsibility and legal liability to the FC. More particularly, thi s situation might \\nhappen during the transition period, thus under the principles explained in  section \\n3.1 on the transition to the new reporting standards. ESMA consi ders as well that \\nthe arrangements between the NFC - and the FC should take into account such \\nsituations in order to ensure the continuity of the reporting in terms of content, \\ntimeliness and adequacy. The counterparties should as well ensure that those \\ncontracts are not reported with duplication.  \\n75. For any outstanding OTC derivatives where an FC and an NFC - report to two \\ndifferent Trade Repositories at the moment the responsibility and legal liability are \\ntransferred, the outstanding OTC derivatives of the NF C- should be ported to the \\nTR of the FC at that moment, unless the FC decides to become client of the TR of \\nthe NFC - and report the OTC derivatives concluded with the NFC - to that TR. \\nSimilarly, each time when NFC changes its status from NFC - to NFC+, and thus \\n \\n \\n \\n27 \\nthe responsibility and legal liability is transferred to the NFC, the outstanding OTC \\nderivatives concluded with the FC should be ported to the TR of the NFC, unless \\nthe NFC decides to become client of the TR of the FC and report the OTC \\nderivatives c oncluded with the FC to that TR. Any such transfer of OTC derivatives \\nbetween the TRs of any pair of FC -NFC should be performed following the \\nGuidelines on transfer of data between Trade Repositories17 (in particular, the \\nderivatives subject to transfer sh ould not be cancelled and re -reported by the \\ncounterparties, but rather transferred as specified in the Guidelines).  \\n76. With regard to Article 9(2) (b) of the ITS on reporting , the fields 1.7 ‘Clearing \\nthreshold of counterparty 1 ’ and 1.13 ‘Clearing threshold of counterparty 2 ’ are part \\nof the reportable details. To the extent possible, the NFC - should inform the FC of \\nan anticipated change in its status ahead of the date of the required annual \\ncalculation of its positions pursuant to the Article 10(1 ) of EMIR to avoid any \\ndisruption in the continuity of reporting. While the status of the NFC is known and \\nprimarily assessed by the NFC itself, the FC should collect the information on a \\nregular basis in order to be able to perform its own reporting. When  the FC becomes \\naware of a change from NFC+ to NFC - after the calculation date, it should submit \\nthe missing reports pertaining to the OTC derivatives that were concluded, modified \\nor terminated after that date without undue delay. Such submissions should be \\ndone, upon having received from the NFC all relevant details (as per Article 9(2) (a) \\nof the ITS on reporting ) pertaining to these derivatives.  \\n77. Similarly, the NFC should take all relevant steps in order to ensure that it is capable \\nto take over the repor ting once it changes its status from NFC - to NFC+ in order to \\nensure continuity of the reporting in terms of content, timeliness and adequacy. This \\nincludes as well that the NFC should inform the FC as soon as possible and \\ntherefore, the NFC should ideally  anticipate the change.  \\n78. With regard to the Article 9(2) (c) of the ITS on reporting , NFCs are responsible for \\nensuring that their LEI is renewed in a timely fashion. In order to avoid disruptions \\nin the reporting and for the FC to avoid having to manage rej ections  by the TRs,  \\nESMA considers that FC can e.g. timely liaise with the NFC - so that the latter \\nrenews its LEI. Nevertheless, if the NFC - has not timely renewed its LEI and \\ntherefore FC was not able to successfully report on behalf of NFC -, the FC shoul d \\nsubmit the missing reports without undue delay as soon as the LEI of the NFC - is \\nrenewed.   \\n79. While the obligation to report OTC derivatives is no longer on the NFC -, ESMA \\nconsiders that it is of utmost importance that both counterparties, including the \\nNFC-, are in possession of complete and up -to-date information about the details \\nof the derivatives that have been reported to a TR. Therefore, ESMA considers that \\nFCs can e.g. provide its NFC - counterparties on regular basis (e.g. monthly) with \\nthe informat ion concerning the contracts that are outstanding at the TRs. Being able \\nto compare its own records with the records of derivatives stored at the TRs on a \\nregular basis would support the NFC - in fulfilling its other obligations as defined \\n \\n17 https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma74 -362-2351_final_report_ -\\n_guidelines_on_data_transfer_between_trade_repositories_emir_sftr.pdf  \\n \\n \\n \\n28 \\nunder EMIR and mo re particularly to EMIR Article 9(2) “Counterparties shall keep \\na record of any derivative contract they have concluded and any modification for at \\nleast five years following the termination of the contract” or other relevant \\nregulations as well as to be a ware of the information that is available to the entities \\nlisted in EMIR Article 81(3) on their behalf.   \\n80. For the avoidance of doubt, ESMA stresses again that all the aforementioned \\nclarifications apply only to OTC derivatives. Thus, for ETDs , i.e. any der ivative \\ncontracts that do not qualify as OTC based on the definition of Article 2(7) of EMIR \\nas amended by Article 32 of SFTR, the counterparty remains responsible and \\nlegally liable for reporting the details to a T R and the provisions related to the \\ntrans fer of responsibility and legal liability do not apply. Counterparties cannot \\nassume that all options and futures traded on venue are ETDs.   \\n81. In very specific cases, external circumstances might lead to a change in the \\nallocation of responsibility for the reporting e.g.:  \\na. FC that was established in an EEA country  will be established in a third country , \\nb. Derivative contract changes from OTC to ETD or vice versa.  \\n82. In such cases, ESMA considers that the allocation of responsibility depends on the \\nsituation at eac h time a reporting requirement arises , e.g. for a derivative contract \\nthat is considered OTC until 30//11 and becomes an ETD as of the 1/12, the FC is \\nresponsible for reporting until 30/11 included while the NFC - will be become \\nresponsible and legally liab le for reporting as from the 1/12. All othe r provisions of \\nthese guidelines will be applicable in accordance with the allocation of \\nresponsibility.  \\n83. Another limitation is that the provisions on allocation of responsibility only apply \\nwhen the FC is establis hed in the Union or where the conditions laid down in the \\nfourth sub -paragraph of Article 9(1a) of EMIR are fulfilled.  \\n84. Finally, counterparties should take into account the situation of the implementation \\nof the amendments to EMIR in EEA countries (Iceland , Liechtenstein and Norway). \\nUntil the amendments to EMIR are incorporated into the EEA agreement and \\ntransposed into the national laws of these countries, counterparties should carefully \\nassess their obligations when trading with EEA counterparties and ha ve \\narrangements in place to ensure that reports are made without duplication.  \\n \\n \\n \\n29 \\n \\nTable 2 - Population of the fields pertaining to counterparties, report submitting entity and entity \\nresponsible for reporting  \\nScenario  Report \\nsubmitting \\nentity (field 1.2)  Entity \\nresponsible for \\nreporting (field \\n1.3) Counterparty \\n1 (field 1.4)  Counterparty \\n2 (field 1.9)  \\n FC reporting \\non behalf of \\nNFC- in \\naccordance \\nwith Article \\n9(1a)  Leg 1  FC LEI  FC LEI  FC LEI  NFC- LEI \\nLeg 2  FC LEI  FC LEI  NFC- LEI FC LEI  \\n FC reporting \\non behalf of \\nNFC- in \\naccordance \\nwith Article \\n9(1a) and FC \\ndelegating to \\nRSE Leg 1  RSE LEI  FC LEI  FC LEI  NFC- LEI \\nLeg 2  RSE LEI  FC LEI  NFC- LEI FC LEI  \\nNFC- opting \\nout from FC \\nreporting on \\ntheir behalf in \\naccordance \\nwith Article \\n9(1a)  Leg 1  FC LEI  FC LEI  FC LEI  NFC- LEI \\nLeg 2  NFC- LEI NFC- LEI NFC- LEI FC LEI  \\nNFC- opting \\nout from  FC \\nreporting on \\ntheir behalf  in \\naccordance \\nwith Article \\n9(1a)  \\nFC delegating \\nto RSE  \\nNFC- \\ndelegating to \\nRSE2  Leg 1  RSE LEI  FC LEI  FC LEI  NFC- LEI \\nLeg 2  RSE2 LEI  NFC- LEI NFC- LEI FC LEI  \\nLeg 1  FC LEI  FC LEI  FC LEI  NFC+ LEI\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

It should also be mentioned that EU \\ncounterparties should carefully assess any risks that might be posed to their \\ncompliance with the reporting obl igations in case of delegation of reporting to a non -\\nEU report submitting entity.  \\n92. RTS on reporting provides a specific data element, field 1.2 ‘Report submitting \\nentity ID ’, which should be mandatorily populated and in case where the reporting \\ncounterparty  or entity responsible for reporting has not delegated the submission \\nof the report to a third party or to the other counterparty, the reporting counterparty \\nor entity responsible for reporting will populate its own LEI. In the case when in the \\nreporting o f a derivative multiple entities are involved, i.e. the reporting is carried \\nout by a chain of entities, field 1.2 should be populated with the LEI of the entity \\nultimately submitting the report to the TR. FR on RTS/ITS  (in section 4.1.3) also \\nclarifies th at the RSEs should inform the reporting counterparties and ERRs about \\nrelevant reporting and data quality issues (including data submitted on its behalf, \\nall the rejections, reconciliation breaks as well as other data quality issues \\npertaining to the relev ant data) for which the information will not be provided by the \\nTRs, especially if these reporting counterparties and ERRs are not participants or \\nusers of the TR. ESMA also clarified in the FR on RTS/ITS  that responsibilities \\nregarding the outstanding derivatives should be agreed by the parties and covered \\nby the delegation agreement . Naturally the delegation agreement  needs to cater \\nfor the point in time when it comes into effect and also for the point in  time when it \\nceases to be effective. Responsibilities of the counterparties and RSEs with regards \\nto data completeness and accuracy, e.g. update of LEI, and generally the \\nresponsibility for the content of reports remains in case of delegation always with \\nthe entity responsible for reporting. The delegating counterparty (subject to the \\nreporting obligation) should provide the RSE with all the details of the derivative in \\na timely manner, and it is responsible for ensuring that those details are correct.  \\n93. Delegation of reporting includes the following scenarios:  \\na. one counterparty delegates to the other counterparty;  \\nb. one counterparty delegates to a third party;  \\nc. both counterparties delegate to a single third party;  \\nd. both counterparties delegate to two different th ird parties.  \\n94. In any of the scenarios above the principle of avoiding duplication and ensuring the \\ncontinuity of reporting should be followed.  \\n95. ESMA encourages centralised reporting (i.e. by the venue on which a non -OTC  \\nderivative  has been concluded or by t he CCP in which it is being cleared); however, \\nthis should be always a matter of agreement by the counterparties, based on \\ndelegation agreement . Whenever a third party is performing that function based on  \\na delegation agreement  (on behalf of one or both co unterparties), it should ensure \\nthat all relevant data are duly and timely provided by the counterparties to fulfil the \\nreporting obligation.  \\n96. Further clarifications should be noted with regards to  the delegation  of tasks in case \\na third party is used for r eporting and any possible differences in criteria for \\n \\n \\n \\n36 \\ndelegation  depending on the home member state of the delegating  entity. Firstly, \\nthe reporting counterparty, ERR or RSE can decide to delegate  any task related to \\nthe reporting of data, including the ge neration of the UTI. Secondly, currently no \\nspecific rules on how the delegation  should be performed are determined, however \\nall EMIR provisions should be respected (timely and accurate reporting, etc.) and \\nthe counterparties should remain liable for the c ontent of the reports and any \\nmisreporting by the third entities they rely upon. Legal documentation covering the \\ndelegation  arrangement is recommended (e.g. written agreement between entity  \\nresponsible for reporting and the report submitting entity, even if also subject to the \\nrequirement to report, such as the other counterparty or the CCP).  \\n97. For example investment firms that provide only investment services (such as \\nexecution of orders or receipt and transmission of orders) do not have any \\nobligation to report under EMIR unless they become a counterparty to a derivative \\nby acting as principal. However, nothing prevents counterparties to a derivative to \\nuse an investment firm (acting as a broker) as a third party for TR reporting.  \\n98. In the case when a portfo lio manager is involved, i.e. an entity to which the \\nexecution of (a part of) the investment strategy of a counterparty is delegated, this \\nportfolio manager should be identified (in the relevant field) only when that entity \\nperforms, de jure or de facto, o ne of the roles identified in the counterparty data of \\na derivative report, e.g. broker. Otherwise that entity should not be identified.  \\n3.6 Reporting of lifecycle events  \\n3.6.1  Action types  \\n99. Counterparties should report the conclusion, modification and termination of  a \\nderivative.  \\n100. In case none of the details of the derivative, as expressed in the data fields, \\nhave changed, the counterparties should not report again details of the derivative. \\nThe only exception is the update of the outstanding derivatives in the transition \\nperiod as described in the section 3.1. \\n101. Furthermore, the counterparties that are required to report valuation and \\ncollateral, i.e. FCs, NFC+ and CCPs, should report on a daily  basis the details of \\nvaluation and collateral as they stand at the end of the day, for all their outstanding \\nderivatives.   \\n102. Counterparties should use action type ‘M odify ’ to report modifications of the \\ndetails of a derivative, ‘V aluation ’ to report change s in the value of a derivative and \\n‘Margin update’ to report modifications of the corresponding collateral.  \\n103. Counterparties should ensure that action types ‘ Modify ’ and ‘C orrect ’ are used \\ncorrectly . In particular , ‘Modify ’ should be used to report  modifica tions to the terms \\nor details of a previously reported derivative, including when counterparty provides \\nadditional information that previously was not available at the time of reporting. \\n‘Modify ’ should not be used to report  corrections  of details of deriv atives – only \\n‘Correct ’ should be used for that purpose .  \\n \\n \\n \\n37 \\n104. Similarly, i n the case of collateral data,  action type ‘ Margin update’ should be \\nused to report the collateral for the first time as well as to report modifications of the \\ncollateral data, but not t he corrections of the previously reported collateral details  \\nwhich should be made with action type ‘ Correct ’. A change in the collateral portfolio \\ncode should be reported with ‘ Modify ’ (to update the code for a given derivative in \\nthe portfolio) and ‘ Margi n update ’ (when submitting the details of the collateral at \\nportfolio level). However, if the change in the portfolio code information is made due \\nto an initial error in reporting, such change should be reported with action type \\n‘Correct ’. \\n105. In principle only one report per day, with action type ‘M argin update’ is expected. \\nHowever, if a counterparty identifies that it had submitted incorrect collateral data \\nfor a given day, it should submit a collateral report with action type ‘C orrect ’ for that  \\nday (specifying in the field ‘Event date’ and in the ‘Collateral timestamp’ the day for \\nwhich the data are corrected).  \\n106. Collateral at a single derivative level can be reported for the first time either as \\npart of the derivative report with action type ‘Ne w’ or separately with action type \\n‘Margin update ’. Collateral at portfolio level shou ld be reported for the first time with \\naction type ‘Margin update’. The new collateral is expected to be reported only \\nwhen at least one derivative covered by that collate ral was reported and not \\nerrored . Verification that collateral is not reported when no corresponding derivative  \\nwas reported  should be performed as part of the TRs’ validations. If a counterparty \\nsubmits wrongly both derivatives and corresponding collatera l, erroring the \\nderivatives would result automatically in erroring the collateral as there would no \\nlonger be any corresponding  derivatives.  \\n107. In case a margin update report is submitted to a TR by a counterpart y without \\nobligation to report collateral on a  daily basis  (but the corresponding derivatives are \\nvalid and should not be errored) , that counterparty should  not submit any further \\nmargin updates.  \\n Sequences of action types  \\n108. In order to ensure logical coherence between different reports pertaining to the \\nsame derivative, TRs’ validation rules cover i.a. the correct sequences of action \\ntypes.  \\n \\n \\nFIGURE 6: ALLOWABLE SEQUENCES OF ACTION TYPES\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

Figure 6 chart specify the status of a derivative, while the allowable action types \\nare indicated on the arrows. For example, when a derivative is reported for a first \\ntime with th e action type ‘New’, the status changes from ‘Not reported’ to \\n‘Outstanding’. If a counterparty reports subsequently ‘Error’ for that derivative, the \\nstatus changes from ‘Outstanding’ to ‘Errored (non -outstanding) ’. For a derivative \\nthat has such status, t he only allowable action type is ‘Revive’ (the only action type \\non the arrows starting in the blue box with status ‘Errored (non -outstanding) ’. If \\nsubmitted - it would change the status of the derivative either back to ‘Outstanding’ \\nor to ‘Terminated (non -outstanding) ’, depending on the maturity/termination date of \\nthat derivative. All dependencies between action types and statuses of derivatives \\nindicated in the chart should be read in this way.  \\n110. All dependencies described in the chart apply to the reports of a given \\ncounterparty. I.e. the reports sent by the other party to the trade do not impact \\nallowable action types reported by the first counterparty. It applies in particular to \\naction type ‘Er ror’, meaning that if one counterparty submitted ‘Error’ for a given \\nUTI (and has not reported ‘Revive’ afterwards), only that counterparty will not be \\nable to send further reports (other than ‘Revive’) for this UTI. In this way, if one \\ncounterparty report s ‘Error’ by mistake, it will not prevent the other counterparty \\nfrom timely reporting relevant lifecycle events.  \\n111. Action types ‘Modify’, ‘Correct’, ‘ Margin update ’ and ‘Valuation’ do not impact \\nthe status of the derivative. They are allowed to be reported  for terminated trades \\nonly in the case of late reporting but they cannot be used to change the status of \\nthe derivative to outstanding (e.g. by modifying the maturity date). Only the action \\ntype ‘Revive’ can be used to change the status of the derivative to outstanding.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n39 \\n112. Action type \\' Revive \\' can be used to re -open derivatives cancelled (with action \\ntype \\' Error \\'), terminated by mistake (with action type \\'T erminate \\') and to re -open \\nderivatives that reached (incorrectly reported) maturity date. Furthermore , ‘Revive ’ \\ncan be used after the action type ‘P osition component ’, if the latter was reported by \\nmistake. In such case the revived derivative at the trade level will be perceived as \\noutstanding, subject to the expiration date. If the counterparty reported new position \\nor a modification of a position, it would  need to be reverted separately (by erroring \\nor modifying such position , respectively).  \\n113. Counterparties, when reporting ‘Revive’ should provide all applicable details of \\nthe contract as of the time of reviva l. However, counterparties should also submit \\nany missing reports that should have been made while the derivative was \\ntemporarily non -outstanding. This includes reports with action type ‘ Correct ’ to \\ncorrect any specific values in the report , except for whe n the only correction was to \\nupdate the derivative to outstanding status  (where such status can be inferred from \\nthe ‘Revive’ report itself). \\n114. Reaching the scheduled maturity date  is not an EMIR reportable event  by the \\ncounterparties . No action type applies  in this case , including but not limited to ‘Error’ \\nand ‘Terminate’ . Once a derivative reaches it maturity date, it is considered no \\nlonger outstanding.  A derivative that is no  longer outstanding and is reported late \\nwith action type ‘New’ after reaching i ts maturity date, will be considered non -\\noutstanding.  \\n115. When a derivative is included in the position, the status of that derivative \\nchanges to ‘Terminated (non -outstanding) ’. Any subsequent lifecycle events must \\nbe reported at position level with a differen t UTI (the one of the position), and the \\ncorrect sequencing of these reports for that position should also be validated.  It is \\npossible however to send a correction at trade level for a derivative that was \\nreported with action type ‘P osition component ’, if some details of that derivative \\nwere incorrect.  \\n116. The reports should be sent in a chronological sequence in which the events \\noccurred, in line with the requirements set out in the ITS  on reporting . However, it \\nis recognised that in the cases where an entity  fails to report on time or become s \\naware of the past submission of incorrect information, the entity should send the \\nreports with past event dates thus breaking the chronological order.  \\n117. If there is an error in a historic valuation submission, only th e valuation for th at \\npast date ne eds to be corrected  and there is no need to rereport the correct \\nvaluations submitted after the incorrect valuation message . However, i n the case \\nwhere multiple ’Valuation’ messages had been incorrectly reported and correctio ns \\nwere required - the counterparty should submit a correction report for each day \\nwhen incorrect valuation was submitted.  \\n118. TRs should validate the correct sequences of action types taking into the \\nconsideration the  content of the field  ‘Event date’. With regard to  how the TRs \\nshould treat the reports with past event dates for the purpose of construction o f the \\nTrade State Report , more details are included in the section  6.1. \\n \\n \\n \\n40 \\n3.6.2  Action types and event types combinations  \\n119. Counterparties should report, where applicable, the relevant event type, as \\nspecified in the field 2.152 in the RTS  on reporting.  \\n120. The below table specifies the allowable combinations of action types and event \\ntypes, as well as sets out whether they apply at trade level, position level or both. \\nThe last column of the table indicates when a given action type can be reported \\nwithout an event type.  \\nTable 5 - Allowable action type -event type combinations  \\n  Event type \\nTRADE  STEP -IN PTRR  EARLY TERMINATION  CLEARING  EXERCISE  ALLOCATION  CREDIT EVENT  INCLUSION IN POSITION  CORPORATE EVENT  UPDATE  No Event Type required  \\nAction type NEW  T T,P T   T T T  P T,P    \\nMODIFY  T,P T,P T,P T,P   T,P T T,P P T,P T,P P \\nCORRECT                      T,P \\nTERMINATE    T,P T,P T,P T T,P T T,P T,P T,P    \\nERROR                      T,P \\nREVIVE                      T,P \\nVALUATION                      T,P \\nMARGIN UPDATE                      T,P \\nPOSITION \\nCOMPONENT                   \\n   T \\n \\n121. Table 6 clarifies the applicability of all allowed action type -event type \\ncombinations as well as provides additional comments on the actual use cases \\nwhere such combinations would be reported or , on the contrary , where they should \\nnot be used.  \\n122. The comprehensive mapping between business events and action type -event \\ntype combinations is provided in the section 3.10. \\n123. It should be noted that no event type is envisaged for porting. ESMA reiterates \\nthat porting should be performed in line with the Guidelines  on transfer of data \\n \\n \\n \\n41 \\nbetween TRs21. Action types ‘New’ and ‘Terminate’ should not be used for that \\npurpose.  \\nTable 6 - Applicability of action type – event type combinations  \\nAction type Event type Applicability  Comments  \\nNew Trade  When a derivative with a new UTI is \\ncreated for the first time through \\ntrade and not because of another \\nprior event.  Combination ‘New’ -‘Clearing’ \\nshould be used for the new \\nderivatives resulting from \\nclearing, in particular for \\nderivatives traded on trading \\nvenues and cleared on the same \\nday by a CCP.  \\nNew Step-in When a derivative or position with a \\nnew UTI is created for the first time \\ndue to a step-in event.   \\nNew PTRR  When a derivative with a new UTI is \\ncreated for the first time due to a \\nPTRR event.  Combination ‘New’ -‘PTRR’ at \\nposition level is not applicable, \\nas any derivative newly created \\ndue to a PTRR event is expected \\nto be reported at trade level \\n(without prejudice to the \\npossibility of including such \\nderivative subsequently in a \\nposition).  \\nCombination ‘New’-‘PTRR ’ can \\nbe used in case of rebala ncing.  \\nNew Clearing  When a derivative with a new UTI is \\ncreated for the first time due to a \\nclearing event.  This combination includes also a \\nclearing of OTC derivatives \\nwhich were previously bilaterally \\nagreed among counterparties \\nand subsequently cleared . \\nNew Exercise  When a derivative with a new UTI is \\ncreated for the first time due to an \\nexercise event.

This combination includes also a \\ntransfer of a derivative at trade or \\nposition level from one CCP to \\nanother.  \\nModify  PTRR  When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI is modified due to a \\nPTRR event.   Combination ‘Modify’ -‘PTRR’ at \\nposition level should only be \\nused in the case where CCP \\npositions are subject to PTRR \\n(rather than bilateral netting and \\nsubsequent reporting at position \\nlevel).  \\nCombination ‘Modify ’-‘PTRR ’ \\ncan be used in the case of \\ncompression.  \\nModify  Early \\ntermination  When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI is modified due to an \\nearly termination agreed in advance \\nor due to a partial termination.  In the case of an early \\ntermination agreed in advance, \\nthe counterparties should update \\nthe maturity date. In the case of \\npartial early termination, the \\ncounterparties should update the \\nnotional.  \\nModify  Exercise  When a derivative or position, is \\namended due to the exercise of an \\noption or swaption.   \\nModify  Allocation  When a derivative with an existing \\nUTI is partially allocated. This is \\nused to report the amended notional \\nof the existing derivative.   \\nModify  Credit \\nevent  When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI is modified due to a \\nCredit event.   \\nModify  Inclusion in \\nposition  When a position with an existing UTI \\nis modified because of inclusion of a \\nnew trade.   \\nModify  Corporate \\nEvent  When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI is modified due to a \\ncorporate action on the underlying \\nequity.   \\nModify  Update  When a derivative or position that is \\noutstanding on the reporting start \\ndate is updated in order to c onform \\nwith the amended reporting \\nrequirements.   \\n \\n \\n \\n43 \\nTable 6 - Applicability of action type – event type combinations  \\nAction type Event type Applicability  Comments  \\nModify  No event \\ntype \\nrequired  When a position with an existing UTI \\nis modified due to more than one \\ntype of business events that \\noccurred intraday.  Intraday reporting is not \\nmandatory for ETDs, \\nconsequently counterparties are \\nallowed to report ‘Modify’ at \\nposition level without indicating \\nthe event type, where such \\nmodification is a result of more \\nthan one type of business events \\nthat occurred intrada y. \\nCorrect  No event \\ntype \\nrequired  When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI  or the data related to \\nthe collateral  is corrected because \\nof an earlier submission of incorrect \\ninformation.    \\nTerminate  Step-in When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI is terminated due to \\na step-in event. This is used for \\nterminating the old UTI post step-in.  \\nTerminate  PTRR  When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI is terminated due to \\na PTRR event. This is used for \\nterminating the old UTI(s) after \\nPTRR operation.  Combination ‘Modify ’-‘PTRR ’ \\ncan be used in the case of \\ncompression.  \\nTerminate  Early \\ntermination  When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI is terminated due to \\nan early termination (and when no \\nother cause/event is known as the \\nreason for that termination).   \\nTerminate  Clearing  When a derivative with an existing \\nUTI is terminated due to a Clearing \\nevent. This is used for terminating \\nalpha trades.  In the case of OTC derivatives \\nconcluded bilaterally, \\ncounterparties need to terminate \\nthe previously reported bilateral \\ntrades (with combination \\n‘Terminate’ -‘Clearing’) and report \\nthe new cleared trades (with \\ncombination ‘New’ -‘Clearing’). \\nThis also includes a scenario \\nwhere existing derivatives \\nbecome eligible for clearing at a \\nlater stage.  \\nTerminate  Exercise  When a derivative with an existing \\nUTI is terminated due to an exercise \\nevent.

A derivative at trade level that is \\nimmediately included into a \\nposition, should be reported with \\naction type ‘Position component’. \\nOnly when a deriva tive is \\nincluded in the position after \\nbeing reported  with action type \\n‘New’, it should be reported with \\naction  type ‘Terminate’ and event \\ntype ‘Inclusion in position’.  \\nTerminate  Corporate \\nEvent  When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI is terminated due to \\na corporate action on the underlying \\nequity.   \\nError  No event \\ntype \\nrequired  When a derivative or position with \\nan existing UTI is cancelled due to \\nan earlier submission of incorrect \\ninformation. E.g. this is used to \\ncancel the UTI of a derivative or \\nposition that should not have been \\nreported (e.g. it is not a derivative \\ntransaction)  or to cancel outstanding \\nderivatives when the counterparty \\nstarts to benefit from an intragroup \\nexemption .  \\nRevive  No event \\ntype \\nrequired  When a derivative s or position that \\nhas been cancelled is reinstated \\ndue to an earlier submission of \\nincorrect information. E.g. this is \\nused to reinstate the UTI of a \\nderivative or position that has been \\nerroneously terminated.  This action type should not be \\nused to reope n a position that \\nwas previously netted and \\nterminated. ‘Revive’ should only \\nbe used to reopen the trades that \\nwere terminated or cancelled by \\nmistake  or which were cancelled \\ndue to IGT exemption , so that the \\ncounterparties do not need to \\nregenerate a new UTI. It should \\nnot be used for other reporting \\nscenarios. In particular in the \\ncase of netted position, the \\ncounterparties need to decide if \\nthey maintain the position open \\n(and report the valuat ion \\naccordingly) or they close the \\nposition. If the counterparties \\n \\n \\n \\n45 \\nTable 6 - Applicability of action type – event type combinations  \\nAction type Event type Applicability  Comments  \\nclose the position and then they \\nenter into another derivative \\ncontract of the same type and \\nwant to report at position level, \\nthey need to report a new \\nposition with a new UTI.  \\nValuation  No event \\ntype \\nrequired  When data related to the valuation \\nare submitted for a derivative or \\nposition with an existing UTI.   \\nMargin \\nupdate  No event \\ntype \\nrequired  When data related to the collateral \\nare submitted for a derivative or \\nposition with an existing UTI.   \\nPosition \\ncomponent  No event \\ntype \\nrequired  When a new derivative is concluded \\nand included in a position on the \\nsame day.   \\n \\n124. Where a counterparty submits by mistake an incorrect event type, there is no \\npossibility to correct such information, as ‘Event type’ is not applicable for action \\ntype ‘Correct’. The counterparty should ensure to submit an appropriate ‘Event type’ \\nin the subsequent report.  \\n3.6.3  Lifecycle events and use of l inking IDs (Prior UTI, PTRR ID, Subsequent \\nposition UTI)  \\n125. Counterparties should report, where relevant, linking IDs to allow for \\nidentification of reports pertaining to the same lifecycle events. The linking IDs \\nenvisaged for that purpose are following:  \\na. ‘Prior UTI’ (field 2.3) \\nb. ‘Subsequent position UTI’ (field 2.4) \\nc. ‘PTRR ID’ (field 2.5) \\n126. Prior UTI should be used in the case of those life cycle events where a single \\nderivative is terminated and one or more new derivatives are created. In such cases \\nthe prior UTI, i.e. the UTI of the  derivative that was terminated, should be populated \\nin field 2.3 in the reports pertaining to all the derivatives created due to the lifecycle \\nevent. In particular, the prior UTI will be applicable in the following events:  \\na. Step-in;   \\nb. Clearing  (unless the derivative was concluded on a trading venue or a third -\\ncountry organised trading platform and cleared by a CCP on the same day) ; \\nc. Exercise  (in the case of swaptions) , \\nd. Allocation , \\ne. Corporate event (in the case of a split) . \\n \\n \\n \\n46 \\n127. Subsequent position UTI should be reported when a derivative is included into \\nposition (and reported either with action type ‘Position component’ or action type \\n‘Terminate’ and event type ‘Inclusion in position’). It should contain the UTI of the \\nposition in which this derivative is includ ed. \\n128. PTRR ID should be reported when the event type is ‘PTRR’ and the type of \\nPTRR technique is either compression with a third -party service provider or \\nrebalancing. The same PTRR ID, as provided by the PTRR service provider, should \\nbe reported in all repo rts that are created, modified or terminated due to the same \\nPTRR event. Each PTRR event should be assigned a different PTRR ID.  \\n129. It is possible to report more than one linking ID for a given derivative (e.g. a \\nderivative may be reported first with a prior  UTI when it is cleared, then it may be \\nreported with a PTRR ID if it is modified due to a PTRR event and finally it may be \\nreported with a subsequent position UTI if in the end it is included in a position). \\nHowever, only the relevant linking ID should be  reported in the report pertaining to \\na given lifecycle event (in the above example, the counterparty reporting inclusion \\nin the position would populate in that report only the field ‘Subsequent position \\nUTI’).  \\n3.7 Reporting at position level  \\n130. In general terms,  ’position’ should be understood as  the exposure between a \\npair of counterparties , consisting  of a set of fungible derivatives (trades) with \\neconomic and legal relations among them which allows for a common risk \\nmanagement that results in a net or reduced volume of the joint exposure. Trade \\nand transaction are used interchangeably in this section.  \\n131. Following  Article 3 of the RTS on reporting, it is possible to report post -trade \\nevents at position level following the initial reporting of the details of a derivative \\nconcluded at tra nsaction  level and the termination of that derivative due to its \\ninclusion in a position , provided that the following conditions are met: the legal \\narrangement is such that the risk is at position level, all trade reports made to the \\nTR relate to products that are fungible with each other and the individual trades \\npreviously  reported to the TR have been subsequently replaced by the position \\nreport (e.g. as in the case of trades between a clearing member and a CCP).   \\n132. The categories of derivatives eligible for reporting at position level are: ETDs, \\ncentrally cleared OTC derivat ives netted by CCPs and Contracts For Difference \\n(CFDs). Although in the case of such derivatives  the information concerning \\npositions is most relevant for the assessment of systemic risk, reporting only at \\nposition level is not in line with EMIR requireme nts under Article 9 of EMIR , which  \\nrequires all counterparties to report e.g. conclusion of a derivative at tra nsaction  \\nlevel. \\n133. Contracts with no maturity date, such as CFDs , are strongly recommended to \\nbe reported at position level in order to avoid that e ach individual outstanding \\nderivative for a financial counterparty needs to receive daily valuation updates until \\neither 1) the derivative is cancelled or 2) infinity, because these derivatives \\n \\n \\n \\n47 \\ngenerally have no maturity. The valuation can be provided at p osition level once \\nthe corresponding derivative transactions  are included in a position .  \\n134. ESMA acknowledges the potential difficulties in agreeing bilaterally the level of \\nreporting between counterparties and the impact of such problems on the \\nreconciliati on. Nevertheless , ESMA reiterates  that the reporting at position level \\nshould be agreed between the two counterparties as this obligation stems from the \\nrequirement of Article 9(1e) of EMIR to ensure that the details of the derivative \\ncontracts are reporte d correctly and without duplication. This is also stated in the \\nArticle 3 of the RTS on reporting. The two counterparties to a derivative should \\neither both include the derivative in a position or both continue to report the relevant \\nlifecycle events at tr ade level. Reporting at position level is generally an option, \\nrather than a requirement and is feasible only when all the relevant conditions are \\nmet, including when the two counterparties agree on reporting at position level . In \\nthe absence of agreement between the counterparties, reporting at trade level is a \\ndefault way forward. However, in certain circumstances, the only possible option to \\ncomply with EMIR reporting obligations is reporting at position level (e.g. when the \\ncounterparties are not able to value the individual position components). Even in \\nthese circumstances, agreement between the counterparties involved is a \\nnecessary condition.  \\n135. Intraday reporting at position level is not required for any type of derivatives,  \\nneither for ETD nor for OTC, i.e.  there is no need to report lifecycle events (e.g.: \\nmodifications) of a position intraday. But , in order to report correctly a position and \\nto reflect all the modifications which affect it (also when a trade is included in  a \\nposition level report on the same day), the updated details  and valuation of the \\nposition should be reported by the counterparties at position level at the end of the \\nday. This is in line with the clarifications developed in the sections 3.6 and 3.9, such \\nas the one on  the possibility of reporting the event type as “blank ” when there are \\nmultiple events impacting the same position on a given day in order to simplify the \\nreporting. At trade level, intraday reporting of lifecycle events for ETD trades  is not \\nmandatory . For OTC trades the reporting of intraday lifecycle events should be as \\ncomprehensive as feasible as  of the e nd of the day . \\n136. When a position is created, a report with  action type ‘New’ and the proper event \\ntype should be reported. Modifications of a position because of inclusion or \\ntermination of trades, etc. should be reported with action type ‘Modify’ and , to the \\nextent feasible,  the adequate event type. A position ends when its maturity date is \\nreached. If the termination of a position is due to other reasons,  an action type \\n’Terminate’ and the event type wh ich describes the reason for that termination \\nshould be reported  by the counterparties . Further details are provided in the section \\n3.6. \\n137. Taking into account that it i s not allowed  to report only positions without \\npreviously reporting the original derivatives at trade level, such derivatives at trade \\nlevel should be updated to have an appropriate status so that it is clear that they \\nare no longer open and to avoid doubl e-counting of the trades that were included \\ninto positions. Consequently, the counterparties should report the terminations of \\nall the derivatives at trade level that enter into the position.

In addition, the field \\n‘Level ’ should be reported as ‘T’ (trade). I n this manner, all the trades which have \\nbeen included in a position are no longer considered to be outstanding. Then, the \\nposition should be reported using the action type ‘New’ if the position is created for \\nthe first time or action type ‘ Modify ’ in the case of an update to an existing position. \\nThe field ‘Level ’ should be reported as ’P’ (position) for any reporting of the position.  \\n138. When counterparty reports at position level, any subsequent updates, \\nmodifications and life cycle events (including revalu ations) should be applied by the \\nTRs to the report of the derivative position and not to the reports of the original \\ntrades.  \\n139. All the data elements that are required in trade reports are mandatory as well in \\nposition reporting, with the exception of those that are relevant only at trade level.  \\n140. The field ’Notional ‘ should be always populated in reports made at position level. \\nFurthermore, the value of Notional at position level reports should be calculated as \\nfollows:  \\na. For options: Notional = Total notional quantity x Strike price;  \\nb. For futures: Notional = Total notional quantity x settlement price22. \\n141. Reporting of modifications in the field ‘Notional ’ at position level should take \\nplace only if an event relevant for the position has taken place (e.g. a new relevant \\ntrade has been included in the position, this new notional value should be taken \\ninto account in the notional of the position). Further det ails are provided in section \\n3.17 of these Guidelines . \\n142. In the case where a position valuation becomes zero,  there are only two \\npossible ways to proceed:  \\na. Termination o f the position and reporting of a new one using a different UTI at \\na later stage. No valuations are reported between the termination of the first \\nposition and the creation of the latter.  \\na. Maintaining the position open and reporting a zero contract value on a daily \\nbasis.  \\n143. The ‘effective date’ is the date as of  which the obligations under the  derivative \\ncome into effect, as included in the confirmation  of the derivative or otherwise \\nagreed between the counterparties . Where the counterparties did not specify th e \\neffective date as part of the terms of the contract, field ‘Effective date’ should be \\npopulated with the date of execution of the derivative. At position level, the Effective \\ndate should be represented by the effective date of the trade which has the earliest \\neffective date.  If the counterparties did not specify the effective date of the position  \\nas part of the terms of the contract , field ‘Effective date’ at position level should  be \\npopulated with the effective date of the derivative trade which has the earliest \\n \\n22 Settlement price is not a reportable field  \\n \\n \\n \\n49 \\neffective date or the date part of the  execution timestamp  (this execution date would \\nbe the earliest execution date of the position) in the case that counterparties did not \\nspecify the effective date of the contract . \\n144. The ‘ expiration date ’ is the date as of  which obligations under the  derivative stop \\nbeing effective, as included in the confirmation  of the derivative or otherwise agreed \\nbetween the counterparties . Early termination does not affect this data element. \\nExpiration  date, at posi tion level, should be the furthest expiration  date in the future \\namong the trades that are included in the position. If there is a subsequent \\nmodification of this expiration  date, because this possibility was originally contained \\nin the contract of this tr ade, a modification report should be sent, modifying the \\n‘Expiration  date’ field accordingly to reflect the updated expiration  date at position \\nlevel.  \\n145. The ’early termination date’ is  the date on which there is a termination of the \\nderivative that occurs prior to its maturity due to e.g. a decision of a counterparty or \\ncounterparties. Regarding position level reporting, an action type ‘ Terminat e’ and \\nevent type ” Early Term ination”  should be populated when the entire position is \\nterminated.  \\n146. The ’reporting timestamp’ is the date and time of the submission of a given \\nderivative report to the trade repository. It applies in the same way to the reports at \\nposition level.  \\n147. The ’execution timestamp’ is the date and time when a derivative (at trade or \\npositi on level)  was opened for the first time and its UTI was created . In the case of \\nposition -level reporting, that field should be populated in a similar manner as the \\nfield ’Effective date’, i.e. with the date of the trade that has the earliest  execution \\ntimestamp.  \\n148. The ’event date’ is defined as the date when a given event took place or when \\na modification became ’effective ‘ (rather than the date of agreement to modify the \\nderivative). At position level, this field should be populated when relevant events or \\nmodifications relating to the position took place. Further details are provided in the \\nsection 3.9.  \\n149. The ’clearing timestamp’ is the date and time when a trade or position is cleared. \\nAt position level, this field should be reported using the execution timestamp of the \\nposition as the two t imestamps are expected to be equal for positions.  \\n150. At position level, the ‘Venue of execution ’ field, should be populated with the \\nMIC code (defined by ISO 10383) of the venue where the highest number of \\nderivatives that are included in the reported positio n were executed.  \\n151. A derivative that is a result of PTRR exercise, should be reported at trade level.  \\n152. ESMA reiterates that reporting at position level is a different business case than \\nreporting of PTRR events, both with different reporting rules. The below table \\nhighlights the key differences between the two instances:  \\n \\n \\n \\n50 \\nTABLE 7 \\n \\n \\n3.8 Reporting of on-venue derivatives  \\n153. The ETD contracts are derivative contracts that are  subject to the rules of a \\ntrading venue (as defined in Article 4(1)(24)  of the Directive 2014/65/EU) and are \\nexecuted in compliance with those rules. For the purpose of reporting of ‘on -venue \\nderivatives’, account is also taken of similar trading platforms outside the EU. The \\ntrading venue´s rules provide the execution and pr ocessing of the contract on the \\ntrading venue and the subsequent clearing on a central counterparty clearing house \\n(CCP) within one business day after the  execution.  \\n154. In order to allow authorities to identify and analyse risk positions, the \\ncounterparties that assume the  risk once the contract has been concluded should \\nbe clearly identifiable. Under the principal clearing model, upon clearing, the risk \\nlies on the clearing member (CM) vis -à-vis the CCP and on the client of the CM vis -\\nà-vis the CM. For this reason the following parties have EMIR reporting obligations:  \\na. The CCP clearing the derivative contract.  \\nb. The clearing members of the CCP that are clearing the derivative contract.  \\nc. The MiFID investment firms involved in the trade chain anytime they bear the \\nrisk arising from the derivative by virtue of its contractual relationship with their \\ncounterparties (in particular, with the clearing member).  \\nd. Other parties that do not fall int o any of the categories above and that take the \\nrisk arising from the derivative, except when they are exempt because of their \\nstatus.  \\n155.  If one of these parties assumes more than one role (e.g. an investment firm is \\nalso the clearing member), it should sub mit one report identifying all the applicable \\nroles in the relevant fields, it does not have to report separately for each role.  \\nExamples:  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n51 \\nScenario 1: The investment firm bears the risk vis -à-vis the CM and, thus, is itself a \\ncounterparty. In this case t he following reports should be submitted:  \\n \\nTABLE 8 \\n \\nScenario 2: The investment firm does not bear any risk vis -à-vis the clearing member as, \\naccording to the legal arrangements, the client directly bears the risk vis-à-vis the \\nclearing member, once the latter accepts the contract for clearing.  \\n \\nTABLE 9 \\n \\n \\n156. Where a give -up occurs from the investment firm to the clearing member within \\nthe T+1 reporting deadline without any change in the econom ic terms of the original \\nderivative , the derivative  should be reported in its post give -up state. It means that \\nthe investment firm does not bear any risk vis -à-vis the clearing member, thus the \\nclient bears directly the risk vis -à-vis the clearing member  with whom it entered into  \\nclearing arrangement. ESMA also reiterates that relevant events impacting \\nderivatives reported at trade level must be reported accordingly (e.g. allocation of \\ntrades).  \\n157. Partial executions should be reported separately, because par ameters and \\ncounterparties will be different.  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n52 \\n158. The Report Tracking Number (RTN) is a unique code assigned to the execution \\nand common for a group of reports related to the same execution. It is a \\nconditionally  mandatory field for action type ‘POSC’ at the t rade level  (required \\nwhen trade is executed on a trading venue) . RTN should not be populated at \\nposition level.  \\n159. There is no  one-to-one link between the Trading Venue Transaction \\nIdentification Code (TVTIC) required under MiFIR and the Report Tracking number \\n(RTN). TVTIC is an individual transaction identification code for each transaction \\nresulting from the full or partial execution of a n order disseminated to both the \\nbuying and the selling parties. The RTN is a unique number assigned to the \\nexecution and common among a group of reports related to the same execution, in \\norder to allow for identification of  reports relating to the same ex ecution . Due to the \\nfact that a systemic internaliser is not considered as a trading venue under the \\nDirective 2014/65/EU (MIFID II) and a RTN is generated by a trading venue, the \\npopulation of the field RTN when trades are concluded on a SI is not require d.  \\n160. The investment firms, the clearing members or the CCPs should provide to the \\nreporting counterparties the respective RTNs. Likewise, the reporting \\ncounterparties should transmit the RTNs to their counterparties to allow them to \\nfulfil their reporting o bligations.  \\n161. The reporting of the RTN for CFD (in case they are executed on a venue and \\nwhere a group of CFDs are related to the same execution ) follows the same rules  \\ndescribed above . \\n162. The Unique Trade Identifier  (UTI) is a unique code of a derivative betw een two \\ncounterparties. A pair of counterparties should use a specific UTI for one single \\nderivative , and not reuse that same UTI to report any other derivative  under EMIR. \\nThe same principle applies to the UTIs generated for the derivatives reported at \\nposition level. The UTI must be identical in the reports of both counterparties \\nentering into a derivative. Further details about Unique Trade ID (UTI) are provided \\nin the section 3.11. \\n163. The timestamps fields should be populated as follows:  \\na. The execution timestamp should correspond to the time of execution on the \\ntrading venue.  \\nb. The clearing timestamp should be reported as the time at which the CCP has \\nlegally taken on the clearing of the trade. When clearing takes place using the \\nopen offer model, the clearing timestamp and the execution timestamp used are \\nexpected to be the same. However, if clearing takes place using novation, the \\ntwo timestamps may be different.  \\n164. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, a n investment firm is not \\nexpected to submit any report on the value of the collateral as well as any \\nsubsequent modification or termination of the concluded derivative contract when \\nthe process of co llateralisation takes place through direct arrangements between \\nthe client (counterparty 1)  and the clearing member.\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

Counterparties should report the conclusion of a derivative even if the \\ntermination of that derivative occurs before the reporting deadline  (e.g. for intraday \\nderivatives). In such case the counterparty should send , within the same report ing \\ndeadline,  two reports: one with action type ‘New’ and one with action type \\n‘Terminate ’. If the derivative is terminated on the same day due to inclusion in a \\nposition, the counterparty should send only one report for that derivative, with action \\ntype ‘Position component ’.  \\n171. If the original derivative was included in a position and thus report ed with the \\naction type ‘Position Component’ , and is subsequently terminated, the \\ncounterparties should not send a report with action type ‘Terminate’ for the original \\nderivative, however the counterparties should send a report with action type \\n‘Modificati on’ for the position in which the original derivative was included in order \\nto remove this derivative from the position.  \\n172. Action type ‘Error ’ should only be used to cancel the derivatives that never came \\ninto existence or that are out of the scope of the re porting obligation under EMIR. \\nTherefore, i n the specific scenario where the counterparties agree to conclude a \\nderivative which is conditional upon registration with the CCP and the CCP rejects \\nthat derivative, the counterparties should terminate the deri vative with action type \\n’Error ‘ because the agreed condition for the contract  to take place was not fulfilled, \\ntherefore the derivative never came into existence.  \\n3.9.2  Modification or correction of a derivative  \\n173. A modification to a derivative comprises the repor ting of the following action \\ntypes: ’Modify ‘ and ’Correct ‘. The timeline for reporting is the same as for the \\nconclusion of a derivative, meaning that from the point in time when a modification \\nis effective, it becomes reportable.  \\n174. Counterparties should report only the modifications that have taken place, i.e. \\nthey should not report modifications that were agreed but will become effective in \\nthe future. To give an example, if the counterparties agree to amend the notional \\non a future  date, t his amendment  should be reported only once the agreed date \\n(the effective date of amendment ) is reached.  \\n175. With respect to correction, these should be reported as soon as the incorrectly \\nreported data is identified.  \\n176. It is not necessary to send a co rrection report if, following a modification of a \\nderivative , a counterparty has introduced incorrect information only in its own \\ninternal systems but has not reported such incorrect data to the TR. I n such cases \\nthat counterparty  should only send the modi fication report containing final, correct \\ndata (i.e. does not have to send modification report with the incorrect data and then \\ncorrection).  \\n3.9.3  Reporting of margin  and valuation updates  \\n177. In the case of valuation updates, the counterparties should send daily va luations \\nby the end of the working day following the date of the valuation and populating the \\n \\n \\n \\n57 \\ndate of valuation date in the field ’Event date ‘. It should be equal to the date part of \\nthe field ‘Valuation timestamp’.  \\n178. Margin updates should be sent daily and counterparties should populate the \\nfield ‘Event date’ with the date for which the margin update is reported  (i.e. margin \\nupdate report should reflect the state of margins at the end of that day).  Margin \\nupdates should be reported when they become effective , i.e. on the expected \\nsettlement date, and they should include any margin that is in transit and pending \\nsettlement, without considering temporary settlement failures.  \\n179. In the specific case of margins pre -paid to a CCP in advance of a portfolio of \\ncleared trades, these should be reported on T+1 of the conclusion of the first \\napplicable derivative in the related portfolio (linked by a portfolio code), rather than \\non the day following the date on which the collateral  was lodged.  \\n180. More generally, no margins sho uld be reported if no derivative covered by those \\nmargins  was previously reported . \\n3.9.4  Termination of a derivative  \\n181. Counterparties should not send a report with action type ’Terminate ‘, when a \\nderivative reaches its maturity date and therefore is no longer outs tanding. Once \\nthe maturity date is reached, the derivative will be automatically treated as non -\\noutstanding.  \\n182. If the counterparties agree to terminate a derivative prior to the maturity date or \\nto terminate the open term derivative, they should either:  \\na. Submit a report with action type ’Terminate ‘ where the agreed termination date \\nis for the same day as the notice of termination, or  \\nb. Submit a report with action type ’Modify ‘ where the agreed termination date is \\nthe following day or later. In this case, the counterparties should modify the \\nmaturity date accordingly.  \\n183. The counterparties should not send a report with action type ’Terminate ‘ if the \\ntermination date falls on the maturity date. This includes e.g. when a counterparty \\nexercises an option on the maturity date.  \\n184. In a case of a netted position, counterparties may either decide to keep it open \\nand report valuation on a daily basis or to terminate such position (and report with \\naction type ‘New’ and new UTI in case it needs to be reopened). Both counterparties \\nshould report consistently. This aspec t is covered in more detail in the section 3.7. \\nEvent date  \\n185. Table 11 specifies what should be reported in the field  ’Event date ’ for each \\naction type. The event date, by definition, also indicates what is a trigger for \\nreporting, e.g. the valuation date in the case of valuation updates. The actual \\nreports should be submitted by the end of the working day following the event date.  \\n \\n \\n \\n58 \\nTable 11 \\nAction type Event date  \\nNew Date of conclusion of the derivative or date \\nof creation of a position  \\nModify  Effective date of modification  \\nCorrect  Date from which the correction should apply \\n(typically the date for which previous \\nincorrect data was reported)  \\nTerminate  Date on which termination becomes \\neffective  \\nError  Date of reporting of Error  \\nRevive  Date of reporting of Revive  \\nValuation  Valuation date  \\nPosition \\ncomponent  Date of conclusion of the derivative and of \\nits inclusion in the position  \\nMargin update  Expected settlement date  of the margin  \\n \\n186. In the case where , future dated  early  termination is agreed, the modification \\nshould be report ed by the end of the working day following the date of the  \\nagreement . Such modification report should contain the agreement date as the \\n‘Event date’ and the agreed, future date populated in the ‘Expiration  date’ field. \\n187. Event date must be taken into account by the TRs for the purpose of \\nconstructing the Trade State Report of a derivative. More details in this regard are \\nincluded in the section 6.1.  \\n3.10 Mapping business events  to action types  and levels  \\n188. ESMA provides below a mapping between business events and the \\ncorresponding action types and event types the counterparties sh ould use in \\nconnection with the respective events.  \\n189. Table 12 contains a column ‘Reportable?’ which provides clarifications on the \\nreportability of each event. As a general r ule, however, counterparties should report \\nany new trades that fall under the reporting scope and any modification that affects \\nthe reported details.  \\n \\n \\n \\n59 \\n190. Some of the business events (e.g. the default of other counterparty) might differ \\nfrom a general case pres ented in the table. Hence, actual sequence of the \\nreportable events might in some cases differ from the given examples and should \\nalways reflect the real -world events as closely as possible.  \\n191. When reporting early termination events (due to e.g. full termina tion or early \\nexercise of the derivative contract), counterparties sh ould choose the reportable \\naction type based on the effective date of the event. If the agreed termination date \\nis for the same day as notice of termination , counterparties sh ould use the \\n‘Terminate’ action type. If the agreed event takes place in the future, counterparties \\nshould use ‘Modify’ action type and update the maturity date to reflect the agreed -\\nupon termination date.  \\n \\nTable 12 \\nCategory  Business \\nEvent Detail  Reporta\\nble?

Timely  generation and communication of the UTI is crucial to ensure that \\ncounterparties can comply in a timely manner with their reporting obligation. Where \\none of the counterparties is responsible for the generation of the UTI, b oth \\ncounterparties should make t he necessary arrangements in order for the generating \\ncounterparty, to timely generate the UTI, use it in its own reporting and \\ncommunicate it to the other counterparty, and for the receiving counterparty, to \\ningest the UTI and use the same UTI (without al teration or truncation) in its own \\nreporting.  As a best practice, the manual intervention in the process of sharing the \\nUTI should be avoided and digital means should be favoured . \\n \\n \\n \\n67 \\n193. The 10:00 am deadline for UTI generation and communication applies to all \\nderivatives, including the derivatives reported at position level. In case the \\ngenerating party fails to generate or communicate the UTI in due time, which is \\n10:00 am UTC on T+1, in order to meet the reporting deadline, the receiving party \\nshould contact th e generating party and enquire about the process instead of \\nreporting using an UTI generated on its own . \\n194.

If the entity responsible for the generation of the UTI (e.g. a third -country venue \\nor a confirmation platform) is not subject to EMIR and is not  able/willing to generate \\nthe UTI , the parties should follow the next step in the UTI -generation waterfall.  If \\nthe final step of the waterfall ass igns the responsibility to the other counterparty that \\nis not an EU counterparty  and that counterparty does not provide the UTI , the \\nreporting counterparty should generate an UTI on its own in order to meet the \\nreporting deadline.  However, if the non -EU counterparty provides the  UTI late and \\nthe EU counterparty has already reported with its own UTI , the EU counterparty \\nshould Error the reported derivative  and rereport with the UTI generated in line with \\nthe ITS on reporting . \\n196. When the process leads to the ‘counterparty agreement’ step, the \\ncounterparties may decide e.g. that always one of them will be generating the UTI \\nor may decide to apply  other commonly  agreed rules, including  a tie-breaker logic  \\nof their choice . The chosen logic should be straightforward enough to ensure clear \\ndetermination of the counterparty responsible for the UTI generation in all cases.  \\n197. The solution of last resort determines the UT I generating entity by sorting the \\nLEI identifiers in reversed order. For this purpose, the counterparties should use \\nthe ASCII sorting method, where a digit always precedes a letter:  \\nTable 13 \\n Example 1  Example 2  \\nLEI CP1: \\n1111ABCDEABCDEABC123 \\nCP2: \\n1111AAAAABBBBBCCC23  CP1: \\nABCDEABCDEABCDE12345 \\nCP2: \\nABCDEABCDEAAAAA12344  \\nLEI in the \\nreversed order  321CBAEDCBAEDCBA1111 \\n32CCCBBBBBAAAAA1111  54321EDCBAEDCBAEDCBA \\n44321AAAAAEDCBAEDCBA  \\nSorted on a \\ncharacter -by-\\ncharacter  basis, a \\ndigit comes \\nalways before a \\nletter (ASCII \\norder)  321CBAEDCBAEDCBA1111 \\nbecause \"1\" (digit) comes \\nbefore \"C\" (letter)  44321AAAAAEDCBAEDCBA \\nbecause \"4\" comes before \"5\"  \\n \\n198.

Article 4 of the ITS on reporting provides that the counterparty side to the \\nderivative contract shall be determined at the time of the conclusion of the derivative \\non the basis of the type of contract concluded.  \\n200. Based on the above, counterparties should determine the counterparty side at \\nthe time of the conclusion of the derivative and report either Buyer/Seller in field \\n‘Direction ’ or Payer/Receiver in fi elds ‘Direction of Leg 1 ’ and ‘Direction of Leg 2 ’ \\ndepending on the type of the derivative  concluded, as provided in the table below.  \\n201. Counterparties, once determined the counterparty side, sh ould report the fields \\nrelated to ‘Direction ’, ‘Direction of Leg 1 ’ and ‘Direction of Leg 2 ’ with the opposite \\nvalues.  \\n202. This means that in case where the two counterparties concluded a contract \\nwhich requires the population of the field ‘Direction ’, if the counterparty 1 reports \\nBuyer in field  ‘Directio n’, the other counterparty to the contract should report Seller \\nand vice  versa.  \\n203.

Please refer to \\nthe section 6.2.4  for more detailed discussion concerning the reporting and \\nreconciliation of derivatives with two legs.   \\n204.

Article 3 of the ITS on reporting  provides that the counterparty 1 to a derivative \\nand the entity responsible for reporting shall ensure for the purpose of reporting the \\nconclusion or modification of a derivative that the reference data related to its ISO \\n17442 LEI code is renewed in acco rdance with the terms of any of the accredited \\nLocal Operating Units of the Global LEI System.  \\n208. Furthermore, according to the Article 3 of the ITS on reporting , the ISO 17442 \\nLegal Entity Identifier (LEI) code should be used to identify a broking entity, a CCP, \\na clearing member, a counterparty which is a legal entity, a report submitting entity, \\nan entity responsible for reporting, and a post -trade risk reduction service provider.  \\n209. Article 9(5) of EMIR provides that at least the identities of the parties to the \\nderivative contracts should be reported. This requirement cannot be waived. \\nTherefore, a counterparty dealing with counterparties that cannot be identified \\nbecause of legal, regulatory or contractual impediments, would not be deemed \\ncompliant with Arti cle 9(5) of EMIR.  \\n210. It should be noted that the counterparties reporting under EMIR should always \\nidentify themselves with the LEI of the headquarters, given that the legal \\nresponsibility for reporting always lies on the legal  entity and not on the branch.  \\n211. In order to reduce reporting issues due to lapsed LEI, the LEI code of the \\ncounterparty 1 and the entity responsible for reporting should be , for the purpose \\nof reporting any new derivative or any modification,  duly renewed and maintained \\naccording to the terms of any of the endorsed LOUs (Local Operating Units) of the \\nGlobal Legal Entity Identifier System.  \\n212.  Entities other than the counterparty 1 and the entity responsible for reporting \\ncould be reported with a lapsed LEI  in accordance with the validation r ules. \\n213. When populated, the LEI of counterparty 2, RSE, broking entity, CCP, Clearing \\nMember and PTRR service provider should be included in the GLEIF database \\nmaintained by the Central Operating Unit, i.e. should be a valid LEI .  \\n214. The point in time relevant for the validation of the LEI status is the date of \\nreporting, a s specified in the validation rules . \\n215. The field ’Country of the counterparty 2 ‘ should be populated only when the field \\n’Counterparty 2 identifier type ‘ is ‘False’, i.e. refers to natural perso ns not acting in \\nbusiness capacity and  should refer to the code of the country of residence of that \\nperson.  \\n216. Fields ‘ Corporate sector of the counterparty 1 ‘ and ’Corporate sector of the \\ncounterparty 2 ‘ should  be populated with the sector of the counterparty itself and \\nshould not refer to the sector of its branch.  \\n217. In case the counterparty 2 to the derivative contract  is a natural person not \\nacting in business capacity, a client code should be used. Client codes  should be \\nreported only when the field ’Counterparty 2 identifier type ‘ is populated with ’False’ . \\n \\n \\n \\n73 \\n218. If the counterparty 2 is subject to the reporting obligation under EMIR, the field \\n’Reporting obligation of the counterparty 2 ‘ should be populated with ‘True’ since \\nthe indicator of the reporting obligation is independent from the allocation of \\nresponsibility for reporting and from any delegation arrangement.  \\n219. It should be noted that the field ’Reporting obligation of the counterparty 2 ‘ \\nshould  be populated  with ‘False’  when counterparty  2 to the derivative contract is a \\nnatural person not acting in business capacity, a non -EU counterparty , a non -EU \\nCCP , an enti ty referred in Article 1(4) of EMIR (BIS, Central Banks, etc) . \\n \\nTable 15 \\nCounterparty 2  Reporting obligation \\nof the counterparty 2  \\nEU FC/NFC/CCP  TRUE  \\nNON EU FC/NFC/CCP  FALSE  \\nNATURAL PERSON NOT ACTING IN \\nBUSINESS CAPACITY  FALSE  \\nENTITIES IN ART. 1(4) OF EMIR (BIS, \\nCENTRAL BANKS, etc) FALSE  \\nENTITIES IN ART. 1(5) OF EMIR \\n(MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT \\nBANKS, ESM,ESF, etc) TRUE  \\n \\n220. Client codes should be reported as ’LEI of Counterparty 1 + Internal Identifier of \\nIndividuals ‘, where such internal identifier should be unique at the level of the given \\nreporting counterparty (counterparty 1), i.e. the client it is not expected to have one \\nsingle internal identifier across all entities it trades with. Furthermore, the internal \\nident ifier adopted for the identifications of individuals should not contain information \\nreferred to as personal data (irrespective of its sensitivity) . \\n221. The LEI component of the client code should not be updated when the reporting \\ncounterparty (to which the LEI  pertains) undergoes the corporate event.  \\n222. Furthermore, i n case of corporate events, where  the affected counterparties \\nhave the same individual as a client and the internal identifier associated with that \\nindividual is different between the involved parties , after the merger the reporting \\ncounterparty  should identify that individual with one of the previously  used internal \\nidentifier s in order to ensure the  traceability . In particular for newly concluded \\nderivatives only one of the client codes should  be consistently used, the one starting \\nwith the LEI of the reporting cou nterparty  after the merger . Reportable lifecycle \\nevents for derivatives outstanding at the time of the merger should be reported with \\nthe client codes which were  used before the corporate event  for those derivatives . \\nTABLE 16 REPORTING OF CLIENT CODES IN CASE OF A CORPORATE EVENT\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

Article 8 of the ITS on reporting stipulates that when a counterparty undergoes \\na corporate action resulting in the change of its LEI, that counterparty or the ERR \\nor the entity to which reporting was delegated should notify the relevant TR of the \\nchange a nd request update of the LEI. Furthermore, Article 2 of the RTS on data \\nquality provides that  the TR to which the request is addressed  shall identify the \\nderivatives outstanding at the time of the corporate restructuring event where the \\nentity is reported with the old identifier in the field ‘Counterparty 1  (Reporting \\ncounterparty)’  or in the fie ld ‘Counterparty 2 ’ as informed in the rele vant request \\nand shall replace the old identifier with the new LEI in the reports relating to all \\nthose derivatives pertaining to that counterparty at the time of the corporate event.   \\n224. Article 2 of the RTS  on data quality  also provides the procedure and th e timeline \\nto be followed by trade repositories in order to properly finalize the update of the \\nLEIs for all the derivatives pertaining to the counterparty submitting the request \\nunder Article 8 of the ITS on reporting.  \\n225. The LEI update should occur on the d ate of the corporate restructuring event. If \\nthe request to update the LEI due to a corporate event is received by the TR later \\nthan 30 days prior to the corporate event, the TR should perform the update as \\nsoon as possible and no later than 30 calendar da ys from receiving the request . \\n226. To ensure the timely communication between the entity involved in the update \\nand its TR, the counterparty affected by the change  should provide all the \\nnecessary information on the merger to its TR no later than 30 calendar days prior \\nto the corporate even t date.  \\n227. In case the affected counterparty is a third country entity, the EU counterparty \\nor entity responsible for reporting or the entity to which the EU reporting \\ncounterparty delegated the reporting should be responsible for communicating the \\nchange to the TR.  \\n228. In addition, when a counterparty is not responsible and legally liable for \\nreporting, the entity responsible for reporting is responsible for communicating the\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

In this case, the TRs should perfo rm such an update only following a \\nconfirmation of the impacted records by the counterparty 1 or the entity responsible \\nfor reporting, as applicable . Where the counterparty 1 or the entity responsible for \\nreporting does not reply in due time for the perfor mance of the update, the update \\nof the relevant details of these  derivatives could be performed by submitting the \\nrelevant report s with action type ‘MODI ’. \\n236. In case the corporate event affects only a subset of derivatives (e.g. spin offs), \\nTRs should put in  place common procedures for updating LEI data on those \\nderivatives contracts that could be affected by partial changes of the LEIs. The \\nresponsibility for indicating which UTIs are affected by the change should remain \\nwith the counterparties or entities r esponsible for reporting.  Both \\ncounterparties/ERRs are expected to communicate the change to their TRs.  \\n237. Trades with the old LEI errored or terminated by mistake that are actually \\noutstanding at the time of the corporate event should be necessarily “revived ” \\nbefore (or at the time of) the corporate event. In case the counte rparty or the ERR, \\nas applicable, realize s after the corporate event that a derivative with the old LEI \\nterminated/errored by mistake has not been revived before (or at the time of) the \\ncorporate event, the counterparty should report that derivative with a new UTI. In \\nturn the other counterparty should terminate its derivative and re -report it with the \\nnewly generated  UTI. This latter scenario should occur only as a last resort option \\nconsi dering that counterparties affected by a corporate event should carefully \\nassess the perimeter of outstanding derivatives before the corporate event occurs.  \\n238. TRs should produce any information about the update of the LEI, as specified \\nin paragraph 3 (b) of Article 2 of RTS on data quality, in machine readable format \\nin order to favour a timely and automatic process of LEI update by the stakeholders \\n(TRs, reporting counterparties, report submitting entities, entities responsible for \\nreporting).  \\n239. The procedure  provided in Article 2 of the RTS on data quality and the timelines \\nprovided above should be followed also with reference to the scenario of update \\nfrom BIC or other identifiers to LEI.  \\n3.15 Identification and classification of products  \\nGeneral clarifications  \\n240. As specified in the ITS on reporting, the derivatives that are (i) admitted to \\ntrading or traded on a trading venue or (ii) are traded on a systematic internaliser \\nand their underlying is admitted to trading or traded on a trading venue or is an \\nindex or basket composed of instruments traded on a trading venue ; should be \\nidentified in field 2.7 using an ISO 6166 International Securities Identification \\nNumber (ISIN) code. The remaining derivatives should be identified in field 2.8 \\nusing an ISO 4914 Unique  Product Identifier (UPI) code. In the specific case of \\nderiva tives traded on exchange in a third country, the identification of the product \\nis not required if both  ISIN and UP I are not  available . In this way the relevant \\nderivative product s can be uniquely identified, while the counterparties are required \\n \\n \\n \\n77 \\nto provide only one way of identification for a given product and consistency with \\nMiFIR reporting requirements is retained.  \\n241. Additionally, the counterparties should classify all derivatives using the ISO \\n10692 Classification of Financial Instrument (CFI) code ( field 2.9). Counterparties \\nshould always use official sources for the CFI. For this purpose, the CFI assigned \\nby ANNA D erivatives Service Bureau (ANNA DSB) or the relevant National \\nNumbering Agency (NNA) should be used. Further information can be obtained \\nfrom ANNA DSB ( https://www.anna -dsb.com/ufaqs/cfi -code/ ), from ANNA  \\n(http://www.annaweb.org/standards/about -identification -standards/ ), or from the \\nrelevant NNA of the de rivative.  \\n242. Counterparties should report only valid CFIs.  In the case of derivatives identified \\nwith a UPI, the CFI is expected to be always available. For the other derivatives, i f \\nthe CFI does not exist in the official sources, the  counterparties should re quest it to \\nthe relevant NNA.  \\nIdentification of FX swaps   \\n243. If the counterparties enter into an FX swap (regardless of how the product has \\nbeen subsequently confirmed or settled), they should report it in a single report and \\nidentify the product with the UPI or ISIN pertaining to that FX swap. It should be \\nnoted that the UPI technical guidance explicitly envisages FX swaps as a separate \\nproduct, thus there is no reason why FX swap would need to be decomposed into \\nFX forwards for the purpose of reporting.  \\nUPI reference data  \\n244. ESMA is of the view that majority or all UPI reference data fields should not be \\nrequired to be reported for the products identified with UPI, once the UPI system is \\nfully in place and both authorities and markets participants gain more e xperience \\nwith the use of UPI. Additionally, similar  consideration applies to the products \\nidentified with ISIN for which reference data are avai lable in the Financial \\nInstruments Reference Data System (FIRDS ). While all reportable data elements \\nwill be re quired at the beginning of reporting, ESMA is already considering which \\ndata elements could be collected from the UPI reference data library  or FIRDS  \\ninstead of being reported to the TRs.  \\n245. Once the validation rules are amended at a later stage to make some or all such \\nfields conditionally mandatory, the counterparties should follow the validation rules \\nand not report these fields for derivatives identified with a UPI /ISIN . \\n3.16 Identification of underlying   \\n246. The underlying sh ould be identified by using a unique identification for this \\nunderlying based on its type. Fields 2.13 -2.18 describe the underlying, and the field  \\n‘Underlying identification type’ in particular indicate s that the underlying is either a \\nbasket, index or asset i dentified with an ISIN.  \\n \\n \\n \\n78 \\n247. In the case of derivatives on indices , the counterparties should report the ISIN \\nof the underlying  index, if available , rather than  the ISIN of the derivative. In \\naddition , under the RTS on reporting the counterparties should report the  \\nstandardised code indicating  the index (if available) as well as the  name of the index  \\nwhich should always be populated . \\n248. In the case of credit derivatives, field ‘Underlying identification’ should be \\nreported in case of Cre dit Default Swap  (CDS)  based on specific reference \\nobligation. For CDS hedging  against the default of an entity, such entity should be \\nreported in the ‘Reference entity’ field.  \\n3.17  Price , notional and quantity fields  \\nReporting of the price  \\n249. When reporting der ivative contracts, in accordance with Article 6(2)  of the RTS \\non reporting , counterparties should utilise field 2.48 ‘Price ’ only when price \\ninformation is not included in another field of the report.  \\n250. According to  Article 6(1)  of the RTS on reporting , counterparties should \\npopulate field 2.48 when reporting the following derivative types:  \\na. swaps with periodic payments relating to commodities (fixed price to be \\npopulated in field 2.48); \\nb. forwards relating to commodities or equitie s (forward price of the underlying to \\nbe populated in field 2.48); \\nc. swaps relating to equ ities, or contracts for difference (initial price of the \\nunderlying to be populated in field 2.48). \\n251. The list in Article 6(1) of the RTS on reporting is not exhaustive. When there are \\nderivatives where the price is not specified in another field, ‘Price ’ field should  be \\npopulated. Examples of such derivatives include futures relating to commodities or \\nequities, where forward price of the underlying is to be reported in th e ‘Price ’ field.  \\n252. However , field 2.48 is not applicable and should  not be populated when \\nreporting one of the following derivative types:  \\na. Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements, as it is understood that the \\ninformation included in fields ‘Fixed rat e of leg 1 ’/’Fixed rate of leg 2’ and \\n‘Spread of leg 1 ’/’Spread of leg 2’ should be interpreted as the price of the \\nderivative . \\nb. Interest rate options and interest rate swaptions, as it is understood that the \\ninformation included in fields ‘Strike price ’ and ‘Option premium amount ’ should \\nbe interpreted as the price of the derivative .\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

Commodity options, as it is understood that the information included in fields \\n‘Strike price ’ and ‘Option premium amount’ should be interpreted as the price of \\nthe derivative . \\n253. If the derivative contract has price which varies by a schedule throughout the \\nlife of the derivative (and the price information is not reported in another data field), \\nfields 2.50-2.52 sh ould be populated in order to report the price schedule for the \\nwhole lifecycle.  \\n254. Examples of the reporting of price for different products  (either by specifying it \\nin the dedicated field or through other data fields) can be found in section 6. \\nReporting of not ional and quantity  \\n255. Notional amount fields (fields 2.55 and 2.64) should be populated in accordance \\nwith Article 5 of the RTS  on reporting . Field s 2.57 to 2.59 and 2.66 to 2.68 are \\nrepeatable and should be populated in the case of derivatives involving notional \\namount schedules. The notional amount schedule , if applicable, should also be \\npopulated in accordance with Article 5 of the  RTS on reporting . \\n256. When reporting the notional amount schedule, counterparties sh ould indicate:  \\na. the unadjusted date on which the associated notional amount becomes \\neffective;  \\nb. the unadjusted end date of the notional amount; and  \\nc. the notional amount which becomes effective on the associated unadjusted \\neffective date.  \\n \\n23 Even though the Spread fields are in the Interest Rate section of the table of fields, they should be populated when applicab le \\n(according to field descriptions in the RTS). Same approach should be followed w hen reporting e.g. the spread and fixed rate of \\nCDS.  \\n \\n \\n \\n80 \\n257. In the case of derivatives involving notional amount schedules, the ‘end -date’ is \\nnot required if the end date is back -to-back with the effective date of the subsequent \\nperiod.  \\n258. In the case of derivatives involving notional amount schedules, t he notional \\namount input in field 2.55 ( ‘Notional amount of leg 1 ’), should be input in the notional \\namount schedule fields. The same applies for the field ‘ notional amount of leg 2 ’, if \\napplicable.  \\n259. When reporting a notional amount schedule, the date sche dules are to be \\nreported in chronological order.  \\n260. Any updates to the notional amount that are not linked to an agreed upfront \\nnotional schedule, should be reported as a modification.  \\n261. In the case where  a position is netted (the notional becomes zero ) there are two \\npossible  ways to proceed:  \\na. The position can be  terminated. If the position is reopen ed it should be reported \\nwith a new UTI.  \\nb. Counterparties can m aintain the open position and report a zero contract value \\non a daily basis. If new trades are th en incorporated into this position the \\nnotional, and other relevant fields, sh ould be updated accordingly.  \\n262. It has been observed that zero notional is sometimes reported e.g. in the case \\nof voluntary right issues given to the holder of a CFD or in the case  of CFDs \\nresulting from a corporate action on the underlying (stock split), thus having a \\npurchase price of zero. This is not considered a correct way of reporting . \\n263. With regards to the population of Notional at position level please refer to the \\nclarificat ion provided in the section  3.7. \\n264. With regards to the notional amount for credit index derivatives following a \\nchange in the index factor due to credit events, the counterparties should - to avoid \\ndouble counting of t he adjustment - not modify the notional but rather only update \\nthe field 2.147 ‘Index factor ’.  \\n265. When reporting non -standard commodity derivatives where the notional is not \\nknown when the contract is executed the following approach should be taken:  \\nreport a n estimate notional amount, which is periodically reviewed when the \\ntransaction is in delivery. If the notional becomes known during the lifetime of the \\nderivative contract a modification should be submitted amending the notional \\namount.  \\n266. To further elabora te on paragraph above,  it is important that the counterparties \\nto these non -standard commodity derivatives agree on the approach to calculating \\nthe notional in order that the reported notional is consistent. For example, the \\nnotional reported is based on a  production forecast. Counterparties also need to \\nagree when to update the notional to ensure consistency in the updated notional \\namounts.  \\nTotal notional quantity fields  \\n \\n \\n \\n81 \\n267. Total notional quantity should be understood as the aggregate notional quantity \\nof th e underlying asset for the term of the derivative. Where the total notional \\nquantity is not known when a new derivative is reported  and therefore is reported \\nwith a default value , the total notional quantity should be updated as it becomes \\navailable.  \\n268. Total notional quantity applies to ETDs more generally. This field is relevant for \\nequities and commodities. If applicable, it should  also be populated for the other \\nasset classes. Fields 2.61 to 2.63 and 2.70 to 2.72 are repeatable and shall be  \\npopulated in the case of derivatives involving notional quantity schedules.  \\n269. In the case of derivatives involving notional quantity schedules, the total notional \\nquantity input in field 2.60 ( ‘Total notional quantity of leg 1 ’), will also need to be \\ninput in the notional quantity schedule fields. The same applies for the field ‘ Total \\nnotional quantity of leg 2 ’, if applicable.  \\n270. In the case of derivatives involving notional quantity schedules, the ‘end -date’ \\nis not required if the end date is back -to-back wi th the effective date of the \\nsubsequent period.  \\n271. When reporting a notional quantity schedule, the date schedules are to be \\nreported in chronological order.  \\n3.18 Reporting of  valuations  \\n272. Please refer to section 6.2.3  for further guidance  on the reconciliation  of the  \\nvaluation  data.  \\nValuation of the contract  \\n273. Article 4 of the RTS on reporting provides that the counterparties should report \\nvaluation as follows:  \\na. For cleare d derivatives - the valuation of the derivative provided by the CCP. \\nThis does not mean that the report should be made by the CCP. The CCP  \\nshould make data available to counterparties so that the latter report. The use \\nof CCP valuation data does not mean du plication of reporting.  \\nb. For uncleared derivatives - the valuation of the derivative performed in \\naccordance with the methodology defined in International Financial Reporting \\nStandard 13 Fair Value Measurement as adopted by the Union and referred to \\nin the Annex to Commission Regulation (EC) No 1126/2008, without applying \\nany adjustment to the fair value. This means that the counterparties should not \\napply for the purpose of reporting under EMIR any valuation adjustments (such \\nas CVA or DVA), even if such ad justments are applied for the accounting \\npurposes.  \\n274. When counterparties delegate reporting, including valuations, they retain \\nresponsibility for ensuring that reports submitted on their behalf are accurate. In the \\ncase of allocation of responsibility for r eporting under Article 9(1a) -9(1d) of EMIR, \\n \\n \\n \\n82 \\nthe entity responsible for reporting is responsible for the accuracy of the valuation \\nsubmitted on behalf of the reporting counterparty.  \\n275. The counterparties should report the actual valuation of the contract (posi tive or \\nnegative), rather than an absolute value. Typically, the valuation of the contract will \\nbe positive for on e counterparty and negative for the other. It should be noted that \\nunder the technical standards valuation will form part of the reconcilable  data, \\ntherefore counterparties need to send consistent valuation (i.e. the absolute value \\nof the valuation should reconcile, while the signs will be opposite).  \\n276. In general, t he mark to market value should represent the total value of the \\ncontract, rather th an a daily change in the valuation of the contract.  However, \\nwhere under the Settle -to-Market (STM) model  the valuation is reset to zero on a \\ndaily basis and the variation margin is settled , counterparties and CCPs should \\nreport the daily change in the va luation .  \\n277. It should also be noted that it is not permissible to report zero valuation of the \\ncontract exclusively on the grounds that there is no market risk because  a variation \\nmargin has been exchanged . Any margin paid or received would be reflected in t he \\nfields 3.12-3.27 and not in the valuation.   \\n278. The valuation requirements apply to CCPs as well as other reporting \\ncounterparties. Pursuant to the Article 4(4) of the draft RTS on reporting, c learing \\nmembers are required to follow CCP valuation. This does not imply however that \\nCCP’s can set deviating standards  - CCPs should comply with the requirements \\nset out in the ITS and RTS on reporting and follow the guidance provided in the \\nGuidelines or in the Q&As . \\n279. For some contracts the valuation changes infreque ntly and may not change \\nfrom one day to another. However, data quality would not benefit from making \\nexceptions and it would be hard to distinguish the cases of stable valuation from \\nunderreporting of the valuations, therefore the counterparties should rep ort \\nvaluations on a daily basis also f or these contracts (in line with the Article 2 of the \\nITS on reporting ). The requirement to report valuation on a daily basis applies also \\nwhen the valuation is zero , irrespective of the model used.  \\n280. The first valuation of a given derivative should be report ed by the end of the day \\nfollowing the conclusion of the derivative (reporting deadline ), either in the original \\nreport with action type ‘New’ or in a separate report with action type ‘Valuation’ . \\n281. It is not n ecessary to report valuation on the last day of a derivative. In particular, \\nit is not necessary to report valuation for intraday derivatives (i.e. derivatives that \\nare concluded and terminated on the same day).  \\n282. Where counterparties report packages compose d of two or more derivatives, \\nthe valuation should be reported on a per derivative basis.  \\nValuation method  \\n283. The valuation method should be reported in accordance with the applied \\nmethod for determination of the valuation. This means that CCP -cleared trades  \\nshould have a valuation method indicating that the CCP’s valuation is reported.

Counter parties sh ould report the delta of an option or swaption derivative, at \\ntrade  or position level,  in field 2.25. The reportable value is the ratio of absolute \\nchange in price (or value) of a derivative to the change in price (or value) of the \\nunderl ying. Reported delta should be unadjusted , i.e. the reported value should  not \\ncontain adjustments pertaining to e.g. counterparty credit risk.  \\n285. CCPs, f inancial counterparties and non -financial counterparties referred to in \\nArticle 10 of EMIR  should use the ‘Valu ation update’ messages to report the delta \\nvalue as it stands at the end of each day. In practice this means that only those \\ncounterparties that are required to send valuation updates are required to update \\nthe delta value daily.  \\n \\n \\n \\n85 \\n286. Counterparties other than those referred to in the paragraph above are not \\nrequired to report delta.  \\n287. The value of delta may range from -1 to 0 for put options and 0 to 1 for call \\noptions. Reportable delta values are ratios, which means that they don’t have a unit \\n(e.g. currency).  In case an exotic option (such as a binary or knock -in/out option) \\nhas a delta of less than -1 or more than 1, -1 or 1 should be reported, respectively.  \\n288. For the specific case of swaptions, delta should be understood as the ratio \\nbetween the change in value of the swaption to the change in value of the \\nunderlying swap.  \\n289. For basket options, delta should not be reported.  \\n3.19  Reporting of margins  \\n290. The collateralisation categories need to be reported in accordance with the \\nArticle 5 of the ITS on reporting . \\n291. The field ‘Collateralisation’ should be populated based on the agreement and \\nnot on the actual collateral exchanged , i.e. if the agreement considers for a two-\\nway initial margin and variation margin, the field should be populated with ’FLCL ’ \\neven though the cu rrent situation might be that no initial margin nor variation margin \\nis exchanged.  \\n292. The table below shows different scenarios of collateralisation and how they \\nshould be reported using the categories.  \\nTABLE 18 - COLLATERALISATION CAT EGORIES  \\n \\n*UNCL – uncollateralised, PRC1 – Partially collateralised: Counterparty 1, PRC2 - Partially collateralised: \\nCounterparty 2, PRCL - Partially collateralised, OWC1 - One-way collateralised: Counterparty 1 only, OWC2 - One-\\nway collateralised: Counterparty 2 only, OWP1 – One-way/partially collateralised: Counterparty 1, OWP2 – One-\\nway/partially collateralised: Counterparty 2, FLCL – Fully collateralised  \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n86 \\n293. As specified in Article 4.2 of the RTS on reporting, collateral can be report ed on \\na portfolio basis. This means the reporting of each single executed derivative \\nshould not include all the fields related to collateral, to the extent that each single \\nderivative is assigned to a specific portfolio and the relevant information on the \\nportfolio is reported on a daily basis (end -of-day). \\n294. The reporting counterparties, regardless of their need to report collateral, would \\nneed to submit at least one margin report ( field 3.28 ‘Action type’ populated with  \\n‘New’), even to advise that the deriv ative contract is uncollateralised. Should \\n’UNCL ’ be the latest value submitted, no further margin update is expected. For \\ndetails regarding the generation of the missing margin information  report please \\nsee the section 6.3.2 . \\n295. It is not necessary to report margins on the last day of a derivative. In particular, \\nit is not necessary to report margins for intraday derivatives (i.e. derivatives that are \\nconcluded and terminated on the same day).  \\n296. When the Settle -to-Market model applies the mark to market exposure is settled \\nand reset to zero on a daily basis and the variation margin is paid without a \\npossibility to return. In that case, it is permissible to report zero variation margin . \\nPost-haircut values of margins depend on associated  risk of changes in collateral \\nvalue and therefore on the nature of the collateral posted (or collected). In addition, \\nfrequent cash settlement of margin may effectively mitigate this risk completely. \\nPre- and post -haircut values need to be reported both. If the risk is mitigated \\ncompletely however, the same values are expected for pre - and post -haircut \\nvalues.  \\n297. There is only one collateral currency field associated with a collateral type on a \\nreport by a counterparty. Therefore , all collateral for a single portfolio collateral type \\nshould be reported in one single currency value for the corresponding collateral \\ntype. The reporting counterparty should report the currency that has been \\ncontractually agreed between the counterparties. If the currency has not be en \\ncontractually agreed, the reporting counterparty is free to decide which currency \\nshould be used as base currency as long as the base currency chosen is one of \\nthe major currencies which represents the greatest weight in the pool and is used \\nconsistentl y for the purpose of collateral reporting for a given portfolio.  \\n298. Non-cash collateral should be reported as its current cash equivalent as \\nevaluated at the moment of posting/collecting the collateral.  \\n299. The collateral reported should be just the collateral th at covers the exposure \\nrelated to the reports made under EMIR. If it is impossible to distinguish within a \\npool of collateral the amount which relates to derivatives reportable under EMIR \\nfrom the amount which relates to other transactions the collateral r eported can be \\nthe actual collateral posted covering a wider set of transactions.  \\n300. The meaning of \"it is impossible to distinguish\" should be referred to the \\nframework adopted by the reporting counterparties for the calculation of margins \\n(and not just to t he use of a common margin account). More in particular, NCAs \\nwould expect the following approach:  \\n \\n \\n \\n87 \\na. if the margin model adopted by the reporting counterparty provides for offsetting \\nof risks between derivatives reportable under EMIR and transactions that are  \\nnot reportable under EMIR, then the reporting of common collateral amount \\nshould be allowed;  \\nb. if margins related to derivatives reportable under EMIR and margins related to \\ntransactions that are not reportable under EMIR are just collected (and held) \\ntogether in a common collateral account, but are calculated separately, then \\nonly the collateral amount related to EMIR derivatives should be reported.  \\n301. The collateral should be reported as the total market value that has been posted \\nor collected by the counter party responsible for the report. The fact that certain \\ntypes of collateral might take a couple of days to reach the other counterparty \\nshould be ignored.  Therefore, margin updates should be reported when they \\nbecome effective, i.e. on the expected settlem ent date and they should include any \\nmargin that is in transit and pending settlement, without considering temporary \\nsettlement failures.  \\n302. Although margins data are not reconcilable  fields, margins reported by the \\ncounterparties should  be consistent.   \\n303. The R TS on reporting specif ies that where the collateral related to a contract is \\nreported on a portfolio basis, the reporting counterparty sh ould report to the trade \\nrepository a code identifying the portfolio related to the reported contract.  This field \\nshoul d only be populated if the field ‘ Collateral portfolio indicator ’ has the value ‘Y’.  \\nIt is up to the reporting counterparty to determine what unique value to populate  in \\nthe field ‘ Collateral portfolio code’. Therefore, different counterparties to a derivative \\ncontract can use different collateral portfolio codes.  \\n304. The ITS on reporting specif ies that the field 3.27 ‘Collateral portfolio code’ can \\nhave up to 52 alphanumerical characters and that  special characters  are not \\nallowed . Therefore, a collateral portfolio code that is less than 52 characters in \\nlength is permissible provided that it meets the other criteria laid out here.  \\n305. It is permissible to use a value in this field that is supplied by the CCP, but this \\nis not re quired and other values could be used.  \\n306. However, NCAs would expect that portfolios reported by the two counterparties, \\nirrespective of the codes, cover the same collateral.  \\n307. Excess collateral should capture only additional collateral that is posted or receiv ed \\nseparately and independently from the initial and variation margin. If counterparties \\ndecide to post more collateral than required and this additional collateral is not \\nposted separately and independently of variation margin and initial margin, both \\ncounterparties need to include this in the initial and or variation margin reported.  \\n308. Even though in certain circumstances no collateral is exchanged, for example  \\nbecause of the existence of an  agreed “Minimum Transfer Amount”  (MTA), other \\ncollateral transfer agreement or thresholds between the parties , counterparties \\nshould report unchanged  margin amount from the previous day. It could occur that \\nin the first day a derivative is concluded, variation margins may be zero. Therefore, \\nin this specific case, if the following days an MTA or other thresholds agreed \\n \\n \\n \\n88 \\nbetween the parties are not reached, variation m argins should be reported as of the \\nprevious day, i.e variation margins fields should be populated with zero . \\n309. In some circumstances derivative s are exempted from collateral exchange \\nunder EMIR, most notably (1) where an NFC - is counterparty in a derivative , (2) \\nwhere a counterparty pair benefits from an intragroup exemption from collateral \\nexchange or (3) for certain derivatives as per RTS 2016/2251 such as (i) physically \\nsettled foreign exchange forwards and swaps and (ii) single -stock equity options / \\nindex options under transitional provision until 4 January 2024. In these cases, \\nalthough counterparties are not required to exchange collateral, the counterparties \\nare still allowed to have a collateral agreement in place  and should report \\naccordingly  to the applicable collateral agreement (i.e. ‘UNC L’ only if no collateral \\nagreement is in place and no collateral is exchanged ).In addition, the counterparties \\nthat are required to report collateral (i.e. CCPs, FCs and NFC+) are expected to \\nreport the actual amo unt of collateral that is exchanged. Where a counterparty pair \\nbenefits from an intragroup exemption from reporting, the counterparties should \\nreport neither the derivatives nor the collateral . \\n310. Either variation margin posted or collected should be reported , not both. Please \\nrefer to the example provided in the table and the explaining text below the table.  \\n311. Generally,  counterparties and CCPs are require d to report  the total value of \\ncontract and the margins. Under the STM model, under which the variation mar gins \\nare settled on a daily basis, the counterparties and CCPs should report the daily \\nchange in the  value of the variation margin . \\n312. The margin reporting requirements apply to CCP’s as well as other reporting \\ncounterparties. To ensure consistency, c learing members can follow CCP reported \\nmargins.  \\nTABLE 19 REPORTING OF MARGINS  \\nDate  CP \\n1 CP \\n2 IM \\nposted \\npre-\\nhaircut  VM \\nposted \\npre-\\nhaircut  IM \\nposted \\npost -\\nhaircut  VM \\nposted \\npost -\\nhaircut  IM \\nreceived \\npre-\\nhaircut  VM \\nreceived \\npre-\\nhaircut  IM \\nreceived \\npost -\\nhaircut  VM \\nreceived \\npost -\\nhaircut  Le-\\nvel \\nDay 1  A B      10.000.000   5.000.000  P \\nDay 1  B A  10.000.000   5.000.000      P \\nDay 2  A B      10.000.000   5.000.000  P \\nDay 2  B A  10.000.000   5.000.000      P \\nDay 3  A B      8.000.000   4.000.000  P \\nDay 3  B A  8.000.000   4.000.000      P\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

ESMA recalls that derivatives executed on UK regulated markets before Brexit \\nwould be considered ETD. However,  derivatives executed on UK regulated markets \\nafter Brexit would be considered OTC. The field ’Venue  of execution’  would still  be \\nidentified with the corresponding MIC code. However, such transactions are to be \\ndeclared as OTC and other fields like the field ’Intragroup ‘ and field ’ Clearing \\nobligation ‘ are required.  \\n3.21 Fields related to clearing  \\n326. With respect to the field ‘Cleared’, under the ITS on reporting only two statuses \\nare allowed , namely cleared (‘Y) and non -cleared (‘N’). \\n327. In some markets a CCP extends an “open offer” to act as counterparty to market \\nparticipants and is interposed between participants at the time trades are executed \\n(open offer model). In other markets, the participants themselves initially are the \\ncounterparties. Subsequently the trades may be submitted to a CCP, which is \\nsubstituted as the seller to the buyer and the buye r to the seller (novation clearing \\nmodel).  \\n328. Article 2 of the RTS on reporting prescribes that where a derivative contract \\nwhose details have already been reported pursuant to Article 9 EMIR is \\nsubsequently cleared by a CCP, that contract should be reported  as terminated \\nusing the action type ’Terminate ‘. The new contracts resulting from clearing should \\nbe reported with action type ’New’ .  \\n329. The same Article also provides that where a contract is both concluded on a \\ntrading venue and cleared on the same day  by a CCP , only the contracts resulting \\nfrom clearing should be reported (novation clearing model). If the clearing does not \\noccur on same day, the reporting process set in previous paragraph should  be \\napplied.  \\n330. With regard to derivatives executed on third cou ntry venues and cleared by a \\nCCP on the same day, Article 2(2) from the RTS  on reporting  specifies that where \\na derivative is both concluded on a trading venue or on an organised trading \\nplatform located outside of the Union and cleared by a CCP on the sam e day, only\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

ESMA recalls that derivatives executed on UK regulated markets before Brexit \\nwould be considered ETD. However,  derivatives executed on UK regulated markets \\nafter Brexit would be considered OTC. The field ’Venue  of execution’  would still  be \\nidentified with the corresponding MIC code. However, such transactions are to be \\ndeclared as OTC and other fields like the field ’Intragroup ‘ and field ’ Clearing \\nobligation ‘ are required.  \\n3.21 Fields related to clearing  \\n326. With respect to the field ‘Cleared’, under the ITS on reporting only two statuses \\nare allowed , namely cleared (‘Y) and non -cleared (‘N’). \\n327. In some markets a CCP extends an “open offer” to act as counterparty to market \\nparticipants and is interposed between participants at the time trades are executed \\n(open offer model). In other markets, the participants themselves initially are the \\ncounterparties. Subsequently the trades may be submitted to a CCP, which is \\nsubstituted as the seller to the buyer and the buye r to the seller (novation clearing \\nmodel).  \\n328. Article 2 of the RTS on reporting prescribes that where a derivative contract \\nwhose details have already been reported pursuant to Article 9 EMIR is \\nsubsequently cleared by a CCP, that contract should be reported  as terminated \\nusing the action type ’Terminate ‘. The new contracts resulting from clearing should \\nbe reported with action type ’New’ .  \\n329. The same Article also provides that where a contract is both concluded on a \\ntrading venue and cleared on the same day  by a CCP , only the contracts resulting \\nfrom clearing should be reported (novation clearing model). If the clearing does not \\noccur on same day, the reporting process set in previous paragraph should  be \\napplied.  \\n330. With regard to derivatives executed on third cou ntry venues and cleared by a \\nCCP on the same day, Article 2(2) from the RTS  on reporting  specifies that where \\na derivative is both concluded on a trading venue or on an organised trading \\nplatform located outside of the Union and cleared by a CCP on the sam e day, only\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

These derivatives should \\nbe reported by specifying in fields ‘ Action type’ and ‘ Event type’ either the action \\ntype ‘New’ and event type ‘ Clearing ’, or the action type ‘ Position compone nt’ , in \\naccordance with Article 3(2).  \\n331. Execution timestamp for cleared trades should correspond to the time of \\nexecution on the venue of execution. The clearing timestamp should be reported \\nas the time at which the CCP has legally taken on the clearing of the trade. For \\nmarkets where clearing takes place using the open offer model, execution \\ntimestamp and clearing timestamp are expected to be the same. For markets where \\nclearing takes place using novation, these two timestamps may be different.  \\n332. The field ‘Clearing obligation ’ is not applicable to the derivative s executed on a \\nregulated market  or a third -country equivalent market  and it should be left blank. In \\nthe case of cleared trades, this field should be populated with ‘UKWN’ and the field \\n‘Cleared’ with  ‘Y’. \\n333. The field ‘Central counterparty’ should only be populated with the identifier of a \\nCCP, i.e. a central counterparty which meets the definition of Article 2(1) of EMIR. \\nTherefore, when a derivative contract is cleared by an entity which is not a CCP \\nwithin the meaning of EMIR, the clearing house should not be identified in the field \\n‘Central counterparty’.  \\n334. When a derivative is executed in an anonymised market and cleared by a \\nclearing house, the counterparty executing the derivative should request the trading \\nvenue or the clearing house that matches the counterparties to disclose the identity \\nof the other counterparty  before the reporting deadline.  \\n3.22 Fields related to confirmation  \\n335. Date and time of confirmation, as determined pursuant to Article 12 of the RTS \\non clearing arrangements constitute the ‘Confirmation timestamp ‘ that should be \\nreported in th e field 2.28, confirmation means should be reported in the field 2.29 \\n’Confirmed ’. \\n336. The timely confirmation requirement applies only to non -cleared OTC  contracts  \\n(confirmation timestamp and confirmation means should  not be reported for ETD s \\nnor for cleared OTC derivatives ). It applies wherever a new derivative contract is \\nconcluded, inclu ding as a result of novation and portfolio compression of previously \\nconcluded contracts. The requirement does not apply to terminations provided that \\nthe termination removes all residual obligations in respect of that derivative. The \\nfields ’Confirmed ’ and ’Confirmation timestamp ’ should be updated and reported \\naccordingly  to the extent that they are required for a given trade . \\n337. For the field ’Confirmed ’, the value ‘NCNF’ (unconfirmed) should be used when  \\nthe derivative has to be confirmed by the counterparties but has not been confirmed \\nyet.  \\n338. In other cases, the counterparties should report the ‘ECNF’ or ‘YCNF’ value for \\nthis field depending on the confirmation means used (electronic or non -electronic)\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

An example on the way to report the settlement currency for the two legs of an \\nFX swap has been included in the section 4.4.  \\n342.

The same rule applies to \\nthe data elements describing the reset frequency and reference period of the \\nfloating rates.  \\n344. For each leg of a  deriva tive with periodic payments, the fixed rate has to be \\nreported , where applicable,  by specifying  positive or negative values expressed as \\npercentages  (e.g. 2.57 instead of 2.57%) . \\n345. In the case of floating legs, the periodic payments are calculated based on an \\nunderlying reference rate on predefined dates. Floating rates should be identified , \\nwhere available,  with an ISIN and/or with a 4 -letter standardized code, explicitly \\nincluded i n the ITS  on reporting .  \\n346.

The option premium payment is not included as a nother  payment typ e, as \\npremiums for option are reported using the option premium dedicated data element.  \\n349. Novation fees  are not included in the RTS on reporting as derivatives -related \\ncash flows between entities that are not regularly scheduled. Therefore, novation \\nfees are also not reportable as other payments .  \\n350. The allowable values for other payment types are:   \\na. UFRO = Upfront payment, i.e. the initial payment made by one of the \\ncounterparties either to bring a transaction to fair value or for any other reason \\nthat may be the cause of an off -market transaction;  \\nb. UWIN = Unwind or Full termination, i.e the final settlement payment made when \\na transaction is unwound prior to its end date; payments that may result due to \\nfull termination of derivative transaction(s);  \\nc. PEXH = P rincipal exchange, i.e. exchange of notional values for cross -currency \\nswaps.  \\n351. The information provided in other payment fields is only to be reported for the \\nreportable event to which the payment relates and once the payment details have \\nbeen reported, the  values should not persist in the reports of all subsequent events \\nreported by the counterparty for that trade.  \\n352.

If the counterparties did not specify the \\neffective date as part of the terms of the contract, field ‘Effective date’ sh ould be \\npopulated with the date of  execution of the derivative.   \\n356. This also applies to cash -settled commodity derivatives as well as in the case \\nof novations.  \\n357. Execution timestamp should reflect the date and time when the derivative was \\noriginally executed. It should therefore not be change d when counterparties report \\nlifecycle  events (e.g. partial termination) for a given derivative.  \\nExpiration date / early termination date  \\n358. The expiration date is the unadjusted date at which obligations under the \\nderivative stop being effective, as included  in the confirmation. Early termination \\ndoes not affect this data element.  The expiration date can be used to determine \\nwhether the trade is outstanding or not. The content of this field in case of non -\\nconfirmed trades should be as specified in the contrac t between the counterparties.  \\n359. This applies to both OTC and ETD derivatives .  \\n360. Under Article 9 of EMIR there is a duty to report the termination. However, where \\ntermination takes place in accordance with the original terms of the contract, it can \\nbe assumed that such a termination was originally reported, provided that the \\nexpiration  date has been du ly reported . Therefore, only terminations that take place \\nat a different date should be reported.  \\n361. The definition  of field 2.44 ‘Expiration date’ in the RTS on  reporting  specifies  \\nthat early terminations of a derivative are not reflected in this field. Accordingly, \\nwhen an opening of a new contract occurs, the ‘Expiration date’ field represents the \\noriginal date of expiry of the re ported contract . However, when the maturity date of \\nan existing contract is subject to changes which are already foreseen in the original \\ncontract specifications, counterparties send a modification report to the initial entry, \\nmodifying the ‘Expiration date’ field accordingly to reflect the updated expiration \\ndate.   \\n362. The counterparties should report the unadjusted expiration date, as agreed in \\nthe contract, even if it falls on a weekend or a bank holiday.   \\n363. The below example clarifies how to populate field ‘ Expiration date ’ for an OTC \\nFixed for Floating derivative on natural gas  with following characteristics:  \\na. Trade date: 25-Aug-2017 Commodity: Natural Gas  \\nb. Effective date: 01-Nov-2017  \\nc. Termination date: 31-Mar-2018  \\n \\n \\n \\n97 \\nd. Payment dates: Ten business days after the end of each calculation period \\nsubject to  \\ne. adjustment in accordance with the Modified Following Business Day \\nConvention.  \\nThe correct  expiration date would be 31/03/2018  as this is the agreed termination date . \\n364. The following paragraphs clarify how a ’working day ‘ should be understood  for \\nthe purpose of determining the deadline for reporting.  \\n365. Counterparties should follow their local time to determine the day on which the \\nderivative was concluded,  modified or terminated. The deadline for reporting is the \\nend of the working day following that day. The determination of the deadline for \\nreporting in the local time does not affect the way in which the relevant dates and \\ntimes (such as execution timesta mp) are reported to the TRs. The time convention \\nfor reporting is defined in the ITS on reporting .    \\n366. The counterparties  should follow the relevant calendar of their Member State to \\ndetermine whether a given day is a working day or holiday.  \\n367. This guidance a pplies also when the two counterparties to the same derivative \\nfollow different calendars and/or are located in different timezones, meaning that \\neach counterparty should follow its own local calendar and use the local time to \\ndetermine the deadline for re porting.  \\n \\n3.27 Reporting of derivatives on crypto -assets  \\n368. Having taken into consideration the ongoing developments in regulation that are \\ncurrently being discussed about the crypto -assets, the RTS on reporting  do not \\nstipulate any detailed requirements with rega rd to the reporting of derivatives based \\non them . Notwithstanding, ESMA has decided to include in the RTS on  reporting \\nan additional field named ’Derivative based on crypto -assets ‘ in which \\ncounterparties would be expected to indicate whether a given derivative is based \\non a crypto -asset or not. The field is a simple indicator populated with a boolean \\nvalue. This will allow to assess the trading volumes and outstanding risk in this t ype \\nof instruments as well as to analyse how these instruments are currently reported.  \\n369. Only derivatives on crypto -assets that fulfil the definition of derivatives under \\nMiFID are expected to be reported (in line with the general scope of reporting under \\nEMIR).  \\n370. The currency fields in EMIR reporting only allow to be populated with currencies \\nlisted on ISO 4217 Currency Codes. Therefore these fields currently should not be \\npopulated with codes relating to crypto -assets that are commonly denominated \\n“crypto -currencies ”. \\n371. ESMA may develop further guidance on such derivatives based on crypto -\\nasset s once  the relevant regulations have been approved.\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

In accordance with the CPMI -IOSCO CDE Guidance the RTS on reporting \\nintroduced new pack age-related fields. This includes field 2.6 ’Package identifier’, \\nwhich should , on the one hand , be used by reporting counterparties or entities \\nresponsible for reporting as a unique link between reports belonging to the same \\nderivative contract, where the table of fields does not allow to submit the details in \\nonly one report and, on the other hand , where the package transaction is composed \\nof a combination of derivative contracts that are negotiated together as the product \\nof a single economic agreement (see also recital 3 and 4 of the RTS on reporting).   \\n373. While there is a requirement for both counter parties to agree on the number of \\nreports to be submitted for a given contract or package transaction and on the UTI’s \\nassigned to those reports, there is no need to agree on the identifier  between the \\ntwo counterparties. The ’Package identifier ‘ will be u nique for a set of reports \\nbelonging together and assigned by each reporting counterparty or entity \\nresponsible for reporting on their own. For this reason there is no need to consume \\na package identifier  from trading venues  or the other counterparty . \\n374. Table 21 illustrate s the reporting of UTIs and package identifiers in the case of \\npackage  transactions : \\nTable 21 \\n Report #1 \\nCP 1  Report #2 CP 1  Report #1 CP \\n2 Report #2 CP \\n2 \\nCounterparty 1  LEI of CP 1  LEI of CP 1  LEI of CP 2  LEI of CP 2  \\nCounterparty  2 LEI of CP 2  LEI of CP 2  LEI of CP 1  LEI of CP 1  \\nUTI 1234  ABCD  1234  ABCD  \\nPackage ID  PCK1  PCK1  Package987  Package987  \\n \\n375. In the case a package transaction includes reportable and non -reportable \\ncontracts , only the contracts that are in scope of Art icle 9 of EMIR need to be \\nreported.  For example a combination of an FX Spot contract and FX Forward  (which \\nis not executed as an FX swap) , only the FX Forward would be in scope of Art icle \\n9 of EMIR and therefore reportable.  Nevertheless the fields related to the entire \\npackage (e.g. ’Package transaction price ’) need to be populated to provide \\nregulators a holistic view on the packag e transaction executed.  \\n376. If a derivative contract ceases to exist, but gives birth to another derivative \\ncontract, which is materially different (e.g. an option on a future), those two \\ncontracts should be considered individually and not be reported as a pac kage \\ntransaction, thus no package  identifier  should be used to link those reports in such \\n \\n \\n \\n99 \\ncircumstance , while at the same time the field ’Prior UTI‘ would be relevant  and \\nwould need to be reported .  \\n377. The reporting field 2.53 ’Package transaction price ‘ and field 2.54 ’Package \\ntransaction price currency ‘ should be populated with the relevant price and currency \\nfor the entire package transaction rather than the price and currency of the \\nindividual components. If the individual components have individual pr ices and \\ncurrencies those should be populated in the relevant report in field 2.28 ’Price ‘ and \\nfield 2 .29 ’Price currency ‘ in addition to the population of the field ‘ Package \\ntransaction price ’. \\n \\nTable 22 \\n Report #1 \\nCP 1  Report #2 CP 1  Report #1 CP \\n2 Report #2 CP \\n2 \\nCounterparty 1  LEI of CP 1  LEI of CP 1  LEI of CP 2  LEI of CP 2  \\nCounterparty 2  LEI of CP 2  LEI of CP 2  LEI of CP 1  LEI of CP 1  \\nUTI 1234  ABCD  1234  ABCD  \\nPackage ID  PCK1  PCK1  Package987  Package987  \\nPrice  10.23  210.75  10.23  210.75  \\nPrice currency  EUR  EUR  EUR  EUR  \\nPackage \\ntransaction \\nprice  220.98  220.98  220.98  220.98  \\nPackage \\ntransaction \\nprice currency  EUR  EUR  EUR  EUR  \\n \\n378. There can be instances where a price for the package transaction becomes \\navailable only after the reporting deadline ( T+1). If such instance occurs the \\npackage transaction price should be reported with the defined default value , as \\nspecified in the validation rules,  and should be updated accordingly once it \\nbecomes available by using ‘ MODI ’ in field 2.151 ‘Action type’.  Until  \\n379. In the case  that the price for an entire package transaction is expressed as a \\nspread, i.e. the difference between two reference prices, such spread should be \\npopulated in field 2.112 ‘Package transaction spread ’ together with field 2.113 \\n‘Package transaction spread curre ncy’. If such spread is not known at the point in \\n \\n \\n \\n100 \\ntime of conclusion of the package transaction it should be reported with the default \\nspecified in the validation rules  and be updated later  when  it becomes known. Again \\nthis update should be sent by using ‘MODI  in field 2.151 ‘Action type ’. \\n3.29 Ensuring data quality by counterparties  \\n380. According to the Article 9 (1e) of EMIR, counterparties and CCPs should report \\ncorrectly and without duplication. Quality of data reported by counterparties is a key \\naspect to ensure  wide usability and quality of data analytical results. Further \\nrequirements for ensuring the data quality on the counterparty side are set out in  \\nArticle 9 of the ITS on reporting and Article 1 and 3 of the RTS on data quality.  \\n381. To ensure compliance with t he requirement to report correctly, to ensure the \\nconsistency of data, as well as  to achieve  the reduction of reporting burden and \\nalignment of incentives with the entity’s own priorities, counterparties should use \\nthe regulatory data for their own interna l risk and compliance management \\nprocesses.  \\n382. Apart from implementing a common set of validation rules providing an \\nimmediate response on the quality of data at the point of data submission, TRs \\nshould implement a reconciliation process consisting in paring and matching of the \\nreports pertaining to both sides of the derivative  to compare the content of the \\nreports and flag the inconsistencies indicating misreporting by at least one of the \\ncounterparties. TRs should provide detailed information on rejections a nd \\nreconciliation to the relevant participants and users of the TR and also to NCAs. \\nReporting counterparties, report submitting entities and entities responsible for \\nreporting, as applicable, should investigate the data quality issues flagged by \\nreports ’ rejections and unsuccessful reconciliation, and ensure data correction. The \\nITS on reporting also specifically requires the entities responsible for reporting and \\nthe report submitting entities, as applicable, to have in place arrangements which \\nensure tha t the feedback on the reconciliation failures provided by the TRs is taken \\ninto account.  \\n383. With regards to historical records the counterparties and ERRs are expected to \\nback report all identified omitted data  and correct all data misreported to the TRs.  \\n384. To complement the rejection and reconciliation statistics provided by the TRs to \\nNCAs, the entity responsible for reporting should promptly (as soon as it becomes \\naware of them) notify its competent authority and, if different, also the competent \\nauthority o f the reporting counterparty of any of the following instances:  \\na. any misreporting caused by flaws in the reporting systems that would affect a \\nsignificant number of reports,  \\nb. any reporting obstacle preventing the report submitting entity from sending \\nreports  to a Trade Repository within the deadline set out in the Article 9 of EMIR,  \\nc. any significant issue resulting in reporting errors that would not cause rejection \\nby a trade repository in accordance with the RTS on data quality .  \\n \\n \\n \\n101 \\n385. The notification should indicate at least the basic i nformation on and \\nidentification of the notification,  ERR and RSE(s) , the scope of the affected reports , \\nthe type of the error s or omission s, the reasons for the errors or omissions, steps \\ntaken  or planned  to resolve the issue , the date of the occurrence, and the timeline \\nfor resolution of the issue and  data submission or  correction.  The entity responsible \\nfor reporting should provide the notification in a common template published on \\nESMA website.  \\n386. Each identified data quality issue should be provided within a separate  \\nnotification , unless several data qualit y issues are identified where these issues are \\nclosely related, e.g. induced by a common cause, with coinciding resolution \\ntimelines or common bug -fixes, or otherwise interlinked and impossible to separate \\ninto individual notifications. In such case it is possible to provide single notification \\nfor all these related data quality issues.  \\n387. The assessment of significance should be performed as soon as the scope of \\nthe misreporting is identified and the number of records affected by the reporting \\nissue is determ ined. The notification to NCAs should be sent without undue delay \\nafter the assessment is concluded and all the relevant information is gathered. If \\nafter the first assessment more affected records are identified, another assessment \\nshould be performed and  the NCAs should be notified with an update.  Since the \\nassessment will be mostly executed on an ad -hoc basis, ESMA does not expect \\nthe ERRs to provide the notifications to competent authorities on regular basis.  \\n388. ESMA is aware of the need to specify in more  detail the key metrics and \\nthresholds to assess the scope of notifications, as well as the need to carefully \\ncalibrate the proposal. The need for clarification pertains particularly to the \\n“significant number of reports” under point a. and “significant is sue” under point c. \\nabove. ESMA provides below examples of relevant scenarios and clarifies the \\nmetrics for assessing the scope of notifications.  \\n389. Under Article 9(1)( a) of the  ITS on reporting  any misreporting caused by flaws \\nin the reporting systems that w ould affect a significant number of reports should be \\nnotified. The requirement pertains to any flaw in the reporting systems on either \\nERR or RSE side, or at any other third -party reporting system if outsourcing is \\nutilized. This scenario includes for exa mple cases of technical problems excluding \\na large percentage of records from submission, systematic omission of certain \\nfields in the reports, systematic reporting of incorrect or abnormal values in the \\nreports (e.g. system errors in orders of numerical f ields). Since the requirement to \\nnotify the authorities pertains to the ERR, RSE or any other third party involved in \\nreporting should inform all the relevant ERRs if they experience system failures or \\nidentify any other flaw in their reporting systems.  The RSE should  send the \\nnotification to NCAs only if it is ERR for some or all of the counterparties on whose \\nbehalf it reports.  Otherwise, if the RSE or any other third party involved in reporting  \\nis experiencing data quality issues, it should  only inform t he relevant ERRs about \\nthe details of the issue so that the ERRs are able to perform the assessment of \\nsignificance of the issue. ERRs and RSEs are expected to have in place sufficient \\ncontrols at the level of data reporting processes such that any of the above -\\n \\n \\n \\n102 \\nmentioned  issues are timely identified, reported to authorities and permanently \\nremedied . \\n390. Significant number of reports should be assessed separately for each of the \\nfollowing categories:  \\nd. Category 1 – reports with action types ‘New’, ‘Modify’, ‘Corre ct’, ‘Terminate’, \\n‘Error’, ‘Revive’, ‘Position component’,  \\ne. Category 2 – reports with action type ‘Valuation’,  \\nf. Category 3 – reports with action type ‘Margin update’.  \\n391. If the number of reports affected by the reporting issue is significant in at least \\none of the categories, the competent authorities should be notified of the reporting \\nissue.  \\n392. Number of reports affected by misreporting is significant if it exceeds the \\nfollowing threshold:  \\nNumOfAffReports / AverageMonthNum > Y %    and    NumOfAffReports >  X \\ni.e. NumOfAffReports >= Threshold = max {X; Y % of AverageMonthNum},  \\nwhere X and Y are calibration constants, and AverageMonthNum is the average \\nmonthly number of submissions calculated on the day of assessment as  \\n(NumOfReportsMonth -12 + NumOfReportsMonth -11 + … + NumOfReportsMonth -2 + \\nNumOfReportsMonth -1)  / 12 = NumOfReportsLast 12Months  / 12 \\nusing the actual numbers of reports submitted during the last 12 months.  \\n393. To take into account how significant the ERR or RSE is, ESMA intends to \\nspecify the buckets and corresponding calibration constants on the basis of \\naverage number of submitted reports  as shown in the e xample in the Table 23 .  \\n394. The assessment of significance shou ld be performed at ERR level or at RSE \\nlevel if applicable. The RSE should perform the assessment only if it is ERR for \\nsome or all of the counterparties on whose behalf it reports. It is not deemed \\nnecessary to calculate the average number of submissions separately for each \\ncounterparty, if the ERR or RSE report on behalf of multiple counterparties. As \\nESMA’s intention is that systematic issues are captured, even if for a single \\ncounterparty a threshold is exceeded, the overall picture at the RSE should be  \\nconsidered. Following scenarios aim at facilitating the understanding.  \\n395. Let’s consider the following buckets and thresholds:  \\n TABLE 23  \\n  Average monthly number of submissions ( AverageMonthNum ) \\n  0<=A<100 000  100 000<=A<1 000 000 1 000 000<=A  \\nX 100 20000  150000  \\nY % 20% 15% 10% \\n \\n \\n \\n103 \\n \\nScenario A : Three counterparties rely on the same Report Submitting Entity to submit the \\nreports. RSE is below the thresholds, one counterparty is exceeding the threshold.  \\nTABLE 24 \\n Monthly average  Affected \\nreports  X Y Thresholds \\nexceeded  \\nCpt 1  1000  10 10 < 100 1% < 20% No \\nCpt 2  1000 250 250 > 100 25% > 20% Yes \\nCpt 3  500 10 10 < 100 2% < 20% No \\nTotal RSE  2 500 270 270 > 100 11% < 20% No \\n \\nEven though for counterparty 2, the thresholds are exceeded, the calculation at the level \\nof the RSE is below the thresholds and therefore  there is no need for the RSE to notify the \\nrelevant NCAs.  However, if the RSE is not ERR for all the affected counter parties, it should \\nduly inform all the ERRs of those counterparties about the reporting issue, so that they can \\nassess their overall situa tion and notify their NCAs if crossing the thresholds.  \\nScenario B : Three counterparties rely on the same Report Submitting Entity to submit the \\nreports. RSE is above the threshold, two counterparties are below the threshold. RSE is \\nERR only for Cpt 2.  \\nTABLE 25 \\n Monthly average  Affected \\nreports  X Y Threshold \\nexceeded  \\nCpt 1  1000  180 180 > 100 18% < 20% No \\nCpt 2  1000 800 800 > 100 80% > 20% Yes \\nCpt 3  500 10 10 < 100 2% < 20% No \\nTotal RSE  2 500 990 990 > 100 40% > 20% Yes \\n \\nRSE has a significant issue, but Cpt 1 and Cpt 3 are only slightly affected. In this case the \\nnotification to NCAs should  include details, such as number of affected reports, which  only \\nrelate to Cpt 2.\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

Forward Rate Agreements (FRAs), cross -currency swaps, caps and floors \\nshould be classified as interest derivatives . \\n416. When reporting FRAs the counterparties should pay attention to the following : \\na. The underlying rate should be reported in the fields pertaining to the underlying \\nsection (fields 2.13-2.16).  \\nb. Execution timestamp should be populated with the relevant date and time when \\nthe derivative was concluded by the counterparties and following the \\nspecifications in the validation rules .  \\nc. Effective date is the date when obligations under the contract come into effect. \\nUnless the obligations between the counterparties are p ostponed to a future \\ndate, this is the same as the date part of the execution timestamp. Effective date \\nis not the settlement date referred to in the FRA documentation.  \\nd. Maturity date is the date agreed by the counterparties when the obligations \\nunder the derivative expire. In the case of FRAs, this is the date on which the \\nexposures between the counterparties are extinguished by the determination of \\nthe payment covering the difference between the agreed rate and the prevailing \\nmarket rate. This is not the final date of the underlying rate.  \\ne. Settlement date is the date on which the counterparties settle the underlying. \\nThe underlying of a FRA is a forward interest rate and the settlement of the \\ndifference between the agreed rate  and the prevailing market rat e either \\ncoincides with the maturity date or it takes place on a later date.  \\n \\n417. Example of a FRA (represented using industry terminology):  \\n• Executed on 22 February  \\n• Fixing Date (2 day fixing) 20 May  \\n• Effective Date (3M) 22 May  \\n \\n \\n \\n114 \\n• Maturity Date (6M) 22 August  \\n• Settlement Date 22 May  \\n418. In the above example, for the p urpose of reporting the effective date is 22 \\nFebruary - unless the counterparties agree to postpone the date on which the \\nobligations come into effect - and the maturity date is 20 May.  \\n419. In the case of caps a nd floors, the counterparties should populate both the fields \\nrelevant for options and fields relevant for interest rate derivatives (similarly to the \\nexample of swaption illustrated in the  section 4.2).   \\n420. In the case of cross -currency swaps, the counterparties should populate both \\nthe fields relevant for foreign exchange derivatives and fields relevant for interest \\nrate derivatives . \\n4.4 Reporting of FX swaps and forwar ds \\n421. The Final contractual settlement date as specified in the RTS on reporting i s not \\na repeatable  field, therefore it is not  possible to report both settlement dates – of \\nthe near and far leg – in this field . \\n422. FX swap is reported in a single report;  therefore the Package i dentifier should  \\nnot be populated.  \\n423. The below examples  illustrate  how an FX swap and a lifecycle event affecting a \\nsingle leg of a swap  should  be reported under Article 9 of EMIR . \\n4.4.1  FX swaps (spot -forward and forward -forward)  \\n424. Following  scenarios are considered:  \\nf. -Scenario A: Reporting of an FX swap composed of a spot and forward leg.  \\ng. Scenario B: Reporting of an FX swap composed of two forward legs.  \\n425. In both scenarios the derivatives have the following characteristics:  \\n- Banks A and B enter in a EUR/GBP swap instrument on 1 June 2018 (regardless of \\nhow the instrument has been subsequently confirmed or settled);  \\n- notional of the contract: 1 ,000,000 EUR ;  \\n- maturity date of the contract: 31 December 2018;  \\n- the swap is physically settled;  \\n- Bank A delivers GBP and receives EUR for the far leg; thus it is identified as the \\nreceiver of  leg 1 (  i.e. it receives the currency reported in the field ‘Notional currency 1’,  \\nEUR) ; \\n- the exchange rate of the near leg is 0.88 EUR/GB P, while the exchange rate of the \\nfar leg is 0.865 EUR/GBP.  \\n \\n \\n \\n115 \\nTable 31 -

The following scenario is considered:  \\n- The derivative is concluded on 1 June 2018;  \\n- notional of the contract: 1 ,000,000 EUR ;  \\n- maturity date of the contract: 31 December 2018;  \\n- the swap is physically settled;  \\n- Bank A sells EUR and gets GBP for the near leg (and delivers GBP and receives EUR \\nfor the far leg);  \\n- the exchange rate of the near leg is 0.88 EUR/GBP, while the exch ange rate of the \\nfar leg is 0.865 EUR/GBP;  \\n \\n \\n \\n122 \\n- the two settlement dates are 01/08/2018 and 31/12/2018 .  \\n427. On 17 July there is a compression of the near leg, while the far leg continues. \\nTherefore , the FX swap needs to be terminated with action type ‘TERM’ and  event \\ntype ’COMP ’ and the FX forward contract arising from this compression has to be \\nreported with a new UTI  and flagging the ‘PTRR’ field as true . ‘PTRR ID’ is provided \\nby the PTRR service provider WWWWWXXXXXYYYYYZZZZZ and  populated both \\nfor the FX forward and the  termination report of the  FX swap .  \\n428. This way of reporting is envisaged only in the cases where lifecycle events \\nimpact a single leg of an FX swap. It should not be followed in case of a normal \\nsettlement of a near  leg, as envisaged in the original contract.  \\n429. In line with  the validation rules, only a limited subset of fields is required for \\naction type ’TERM’ . \\n \\nTable 33 - New Report (for a swap)  \\nNo Field  Example  XML message  \\n1 Reporting  \\ntimestamp  2018 -06- \\n01T12:00:00Z  <New> \\n   <CtrPtySpcfcData>  \\n     <CtrPty>  \\n        <RptgCtrPty>  \\n         <Id> \\n          <Lgl> \\n           \\n<LEI>12345678901234500000    >          \\n</LEI> \\n          </Lgl> \\n        </Id> \\n        …  \\n        <DrctnOrSd><Drctn>  \\n          <DrctnOfTheFrstLeg>TAKE        \\n>         </DrctnOfTheFrstLeg>  \\n          <DrctnOfTheScndLeg >MAKE        \\n>         </DrctnOfTheScndLeg > \\n        </Drctn></DrctnOrSd>  \\n      </RptgCtrPty>  \\n      <OthrCtrPty>  \\n        <IdTp> \\n          <Lgl> \\n           \\n<LEI>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST    >          \\n</LEI> \\n          </Lgl> \\n        </IdTp> \\n        …  \\n      </OthrCtrPty>  \\n     </CtrPty>  \\n     <RptgTmStmp>2018 -06-01T \\n     12:00:00Z</RptgTmStmp>  \\n   </CtrPtySpcfcData>  \\n   <CmonTradData>  \\n      <CtrctData>  \\n \\n \\n \\n123 \\nTable 33 -

Consequently the direction and the order of currencies may \\nvary in the reporting. Such difference should  be managed by TRs in their \\nreconciliation process so that direction of the derivative is considered based on the \\ncurrencies provided in the reporting . \\n4.5 Reporting of NDFs  \\n433. Non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) are cash -settled fore ign exchange forward \\ncontracts. Such a cash -settled forward contract specifies an exchange rate against \\nthe currency of delivery (the convertible currency), typically the US dollar, a notional \\namount of the non -convertible currency and a settlement date. A  cash -settled FX \\nforward contract is akin to a classical physically -settled FX forward contract, but \\ncontrary to  the former there is no physical delivery of the designated currencies at \\nmaturity. On the maturity date, the spot market exchange rate is inste ad compared \\nto the forward rate  in order to value the NDF. T he cash -settled contract is settled \\non a net basis, in the convertible currency based on the notional amount.  \\n4.5.1  NDF \\n434. Considering a currency non -deliverable forward (NDF) with the following setup:  \\n- Banks A and B enter in a BRL/USD NDF instrument on 1 June 2018  \\n- notional of the contract: 1 ,000,000  BRL; \\n- maturity date of the contract: 31 December 2018;  \\n-settlement date of the contract: 2 January 2019;  \\n- the forward is cash -settled because of its non -deliverable nature;\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

They can also close it partially as counterpart ies may terminate only a part \\nof the volume on one day and the other part or parts of the contract on any other \\nday. \\n439. Each opening of a new contract should be reported by the counterparties to the \\nTR as a new entry. This means that each CFD be reported with  its distinct Unique \\nTrade Identifier and action type ‘New’ or if the trade is included in a position on the \\nsame day it can be reported with action type ‘Position Component ’, even if they are \\nexecuted and then netted or terminated for other reasons during  the same day.  \\n440. Furthermore,  the CFDs  have to be reported even if they are concluded with a \\ncounterparty that is not subject to the  reporting obligation, such as an individual not \\ncarrying out an economic activity and who is consequently  not considered as an \\nundertaking.  \\n441. Subsequent CFDs  do not have to be included  in a position, however, it is \\nstrongly recommended  to do so. As these derivative s have no maturity, it would \\nimply that without including in a position  each individual  CFD by a financial \\ncounterpar ty would need to receive daily valuation updates until either 1) the  CFD \\nis terminated  or 2) infinity. Outstanding CFDs  need valuation updates, but when \\nincluded in a position,  the valuation can be provided at position level in accordance \\nwith the section 3.7. \\n442. Similarly to any other contract, the reported valuation of a CFD should represent \\nthe total value of the contract, rather than a daily change in its valuation.  \\n443. ESMA considers offsetting CFDs  to be reportable derivatives  requiring a Unique \\nTrade Identifier for  each derivative . In case CFDs  are not netted into a position , \\noffsetting CFDs  need to be terminated.  \\n444. Once the CFD is closed, the counterparty should send a termination report to \\nthe initial entry, completing  the field ’Early t ermination date ‘. If the CFD is closed \\npartially, counterparties send a report with action type ‘Modify’ and event type ‘Early \\ntermination’ to the initial entry, reducing only its notional amount  (remaining volume \\nis equal to the not yet terminated  volume). If there is another partial close, yet \\nanother modification report is sent – until the co ntract is finally  closed in whole. \\nThen, the counterparties send a termination report with action type ‘Terminate’ and \\nevent type ‘Early termination’ , completing the field “ Early t ermination date”. In these \\ncases, the opening price of the contract is repor ted only in the  first report ( with \\naction type ‘N ew’) and it is not updated in the following modification reports. Please \\nnote that the possibility  to modify the notional of a given trade, as just described, \\nshould only be used in the event that both parties  in fact agree to partially terminate \\nthat trade. If however they agree to conclude an offsetting trade with a  smaller \\nnotional, then a report with action type ‘New’ is required . \\n4.6.1  CFD \\n445.

Equity derivatives are a type of derivative s whose value is derived, at least \\npartly, from one or more underlying equity securities. Options and futures are the \\nmost common equity derivatives. The type of contract should be specified in field \\n2.10 and the asset class (EQUI) should be specified in field 2.11  as indicated in the \\nRTS and the ITS  on reporting .  \\n447. A Total Return Swap is a contract between two parties who exchange returns \\nfrom a financial asset (underlying) between them. In this kind of derivatives, one \\nparty makes payments based on a set ra te while the other party makes payments \\nbased on the total return of the underlying asset. The underlying assets are usually \\na bond, equity, equity index, interest, or loan.  \\n448. For example, a Total Return Swap on an equity index should be reported with \\nthe va lue ’EQUI ’ in field 2.11 ‘Asset Class ’, whereas a Total Return Swap on a bond \\nor loan should be reported with the value ’CRDT ’ in field 2.11 ‘Asset Class ’. \\n \\n \\n \\n139 \\n449. The event type ‘Corporate Event ’ should be used in the case of lifecycle events \\ntriggered by corpora te actions on the underlying equities. See section 3.6 for more \\ndetails .  \\n450. The direction of the trade of  most equity swaps should be reported following the \\napproach in which the counterparties would indicate whether the reporting \\ncounterparty is payer/receiver for a given leg  at the time of the derivative , using an \\nindicator in the dedicated field s ( ’Direction of leg 1 ’ or ’Direction of leg 2 ‘). See the \\nsection 3.12 of these Guidelines  for further details.  \\n451. In addition, as stated  in the Article 4 of the ITS  on reporting , in the swaps related \\nto dividends, the counterpar ty receiving the equivalent dividend amount payments \\nshould be identified as the buyer and the counterparty paying that equivalent \\ndividend amount payments should be identified as the seller. Furthermore, for \\nswaps related to securities other than dividend  swaps, the counterparty 1 should \\nidentify itself as either the payer or the receiver for leg 1, and the opposite for leg \\n2. The counterparty 2 should populate these two fields with the opposite values \\nrelated to the counterparty 1.  \\n452. More details on the re porting of notional and prices are provided in the section  \\n3.17 of these Guidelines .  \\n453. The strike price of equity options, when this strike price is expressed as \\nmonet ary amount, should be reported with any value up to 18 numeric characters \\nincluding up to 13 decimal places; e.g.: USD 6.39 expressed as 6.39. If the value \\nhas more than 13 digits after the decimal, reporting counterparties should round \\nhalf-up (field 2.134 in the RTS/ITS  on reporting ).  \\n454. The strike price of equity options should be reported in the currency in which \\nthe strike price is denominated (fie lds 2.137 a nd 2.138 in the RTS/ITS  on reporting ).  \\n4.7.1  Dividend swap  \\n455. A credit institution  concludes and reports an equity swap derivative on a single \\nstock where the return or payout trigger is the dividend. The entity reports also  a \\ncollateral and  valuation  update, according to its internal model. The other \\ncounterparty is an investment firm of  its group. The notional amount is EUR 1 \\nmillion, the transaction is fully  collater alised.  \\n \\n \\nTable 39 – Reporting of an equity derivative  \\nNo Field  Example  XML schema  \\nTable 1  <ValtnUpd>  \\n   <CtrPtySpcfcData>  \\n     <CtrPty>  \\n      <RptgCtrPty>  \\n        <Id><Lgl><LEI>  \\n        12345678901234500000  1 Reporting \\ntimestamp  2021 -02-24T17:00:00Z  \\n2 Report \\nsubmitting \\nentity ID  12345678901234500000  \\n \\n \\n \\n140 \\nTable 39 – Reporting of an equity derivative  \\nNo Field  Example  XML schema  \\n3 Entity \\nresponsible for \\nreporting  12345678901234500000          </LEI></Lgl></Id>  \\n  <Ntr> \\n     <FI> \\n      <Sctr> \\n  <Cd>CDTI</Cd>  \\n      </Sctr> \\n            <ClrThrshld>true  \\n            </ClrThrshld>  \\n      </FI> \\n        </Ntr> \\n        <DrctnOrSd><Drctn>  \\n          <CtrPtySd>SLLR</CtrPtySd>  \\n        </Drctn></DrctnOrSd>  \\n     </RptgCtrPty>  \\n     <OthrCtrPty>  \\n       <IdTp> \\n         <Lgl> \\n          <LEI>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST               \\n          </LEI> \\n         </Lgl> \\n       </IdTp> \\n  <Ntr> \\n     <FI> \\n      <Sctr> \\n  <Cd>INVF</Cd>  \\n      </Sctr> \\n            <ClrThrshld>true  \\n            </ClrThrshld>  \\n      </FI> \\n        </Ntr> \\n     </OthrCtrPty>  \\n     <SubmitgAgt>  \\n      <LEI>12345678901234500000</LEI>  \\n     </SubmitgAgt>  \\n     <NttyRspnsblForRpt>  \\n      <LEI>12345678901234500000</LEI>  \\n     </NttyRspnsblForRpt>  \\n    </CtrPty>  \\n    <Valtn> \\n      <CtrctVal>  \\n        <Amt Ccy=\"EUR\">6827 412379 \\n        </Amt> \\n      </CtrctVal>  \\n      <TmStmp>2021 -03-02T17:00:00Z  \\n      </TmStmp>  \\n      <Tp>MTMO</Tp>  \\n    </Valtn>  \\n    <RptgTmStmp>2021 -02-24T17:00:00Z  \\n    </RptgTmStmp>  \\n   </CtrPtySpcfcData>  \\n   <CmonTradData>  \\n      <CtrctData>  \\n        <CtrctTp>SWAP</CtrctTp>  4 Counterparty 1 \\n(Reporting \\ncounterparty)  12345678901234500000  \\n5 Nature of the \\ncounterparty 1  F \\n6 Corporate \\nsector of the \\ncounterparty 1  CDTI  \\n7 Clearing \\nthreshold of \\ncounterparty 1  TRUE  \\n8 Counterparty 2 \\nidentifier type  TRUE  \\n9 Counterparty 2 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST  \\n11 Nature of the \\ncounterparty 2  F \\n12 Corporate \\nsector of the \\ncounterparty 2  INVF  \\n17 Direction  SLLR  \\nTable 2  \\n1 UTI AAAAABBBBBCCCCCDDDDD  \\n5 PTRR ID   \\n9 Product \\nclassification  SESDXC  \\n10 Contract type  SWAP  \\n11 Asset class  EQUI  \\n13 Underlying \\nidentification \\ntype I \\n14 Underlying \\nidentification  ES1234567890  \\n21 Valuation \\namount  6827412379  \\n22 Valuation \\ncurrency  EUR  \\n23 Valuation \\ntimestamp  2021 -03-02T17:00:00Z  \\n24 Valuation \\nmethod  MTMO\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

Another example on ETDs future on equities can be found in the section 3.8. \\n4.8 Reporting of credit derivatives  \\n457. A credit derivative is a financial contract in which th e underlying is a credit asset \\n(debt or fixed -income instrument). The purpose of a credit derivative is to transfer \\ncredit risk without transferring the asset itself. The type of contract should be \\nspecified in field 2.10 and the asset class ( ’CRDT ’) shoul d be specified in the field \\n2.11. \\n458. Total Return Swaps (defined above in the section Reporting of equity \\nderivatives of these Guidelines ) should be classified based on the underlying. For \\nexample, a Total Return Swap on an equity index should be reported wit h the value \\n’EQUI ’ in the field 2.11 whereas a Total Return Swap on a bond or loan should be \\nreported with the value ‘CRDT ’. \\n459. In the case of credit derivatives following a change in the index factor (field 2.147 \\nin the RTS  on reporting ) due to credit events , the counterparties should not modify \\nthe notional , but rather t hey should only update the index factor.  \\n460. With regard  to the reporting of reference entity (field 2.144) for credit derivatives, \\nISO 3166 and ISO 3166 -2 codes should only be used in the case o f credit \\nderivatives where the reference entity is a supranational, a sovereign or a \\nmunicipality, respectively. In all other cases the reference entity should be identified \\nwith a LEI.  \\n461. In the case of the reporting of a CDS with a coupon payment realised in a single \\npayment on the maturity date rather than  with a monthly, quarterly, semi -annual or \\nannual frequency, counterparties should populate  the field 2.81 ’Fixed rate or \\ncoupon payment frequency period leg 1 ‘ of the ITS on reporting  using the code \\n‘EXPI ’ = payment at term .   \\n462. CDS index tranches are standardised synthetic collateralised debt obligations \\n(CDOs) based on a CDS index, where each tranche references a different segment \\n \\n \\n \\n144 \\nof the loss distribution of the underlying CDS index. T he riskiness of a tranche \\ndecreases with the tranche’s seniority in the securitisation’s capital structure. This \\nenables investors to take on exposures to specific segments of the CDS index \\ndefault loss distribution where each tranche has a different sensi tivity to credit risk \\ncorrelations among entities in the index.  \\n463. Tranches of a CDS index that absorb losses sequentially are defined by an \\nattachment and a detachment point. They are defined in the fields 2.149 and 2.150 \\nof the RTS on reporting .   \\n464. Both data elements, attachment and detachment points, are not applicable if \\nthe derivative  is not a CDS tranche derivative  (index or custom basket).  \\n465. For example, t he notional in a tranche with an attachment point of 3% and a \\ndetachment point of 6% will be reduced after there have been 3% of losses in the \\nportfolio. 6% losses in the portfolio deplete the notional of the tranche.  \\n466. ’Credit event ’ event type applies only to credit derivatives. It is defined as a credit \\nevent that results in a modification of a credit derivative, at a trade or position level. \\nFor further details see section 3.6 in these Guidelines .  \\n467. In accordance with the Article 4 of ITS  on reporting , in the case of derivative \\ninstruments for the transfer of credit risk as the credit derivatives (mainly CDSs), \\nthe counterparty buying the protection sh ould be identified as the buyer and the \\ncounterparty selling the protection sh ould be identified as the sell er. In the case of \\noptions and swaptions  the rule under Article 4(2) of the ITS on reporting applies , \\ni.e. the buyer of the option/swaption should be identified as the buyer .  \\n468. The price of credit default swaps and credit total return swaps should be \\nreported in the fields ‘Fixed rate ’, ‘Spread ’ and ‘Other  payment  amount’  (with field \\n‘Other payment type ’ =’UFRO’ ). More details are provided in the section 3.173.17 \\nof this guideline.  \\n469.  For Credit Default Swaps (CDS), when an underlying is reported, the ISIN  of \\nthe reference obligation should be provided ( field 2.14). \\n470. The strike price of credit swaptions quoted in spread, when this strike price is \\nexpressed as percentage, should be reported with value up to 11 numeric \\ncharacters including up to 10 decimal pla ces; e.g.: 2.1 instead of 2.1% ( fields 2.134 \\nand 2.137).    \\n471. The seniority of the debt security, or debt basket or index underlying a derivative \\nshould be reported in ‘Seniority ’ field for credit derivatives ( field 2.143).  \\n472. If it is applicable, the series n umber of the composition of the index used should \\nbe reported for credit derivatives as well as a new version of a series is issued if \\none of the constituents defaults and the index has to be re -weighted to account for \\nthe new number of total constituents within the index (fields 2.145 and 2.146).  \\n473. If a credit derivative contract is tranched , field 2.148 ‘Tranche ’ should be \\nreported  as ‘T rue’.  \\n474. The field 2.47 ‘Delivery type’ for credit derivatives in the case of credit event \\nauction should be reported as ‘CASH‘ (Cash) for credit derivatives that are cash -\\n \\n \\n \\n145 \\nsettled . However,  the counterparties should report ‘PHYS’ (Physical) in the case of \\nphysical delivery of the underlying of the credit derivative from the counterparty that \\nis protection buyer to the other counterparty.  \\n \\n4.8.1  CDS   \\n475. A French investment firm reports the recent purchase, priced with an internal \\nmodel, of a default protection. This protection is based on a bilateral derivative \\nentered into with an Irish investment entity. The notional of the derivative is \\n520.000.000 EUR. The derivative falls into the category of CDS tranche derivative \\nwith an attachment point of 10% and detachment point of 20%.

Table 2 of the RTS on reporting contains dedicated fields for reporting of \\ncommodity derivatives : fields 2.116-2.118 for all commodity deriatives and \\nadditional fields 2.119-2.131 for energy derivatives.  \\n477. In particular, the classification of commodities sh ould be reported in the fields \\n2.116-2.118 in line with the categories specified in the Table 4 of the ITS  on \\nreporting . The reported classification of the underlying commodity should be as \\ngranular as possible. For example, in the case of derivatives on g old, the \\ncounterparty should specify ‘Metals’, ‘Precious’ and ‘Gold’ in the fields 2.116, 2.117 \\nand 2.118, respectively. Only if the underlying commodity does not correspond to \\nany of the specific categories included in the ITS  on reporting , it should be reported \\nas ‘Other’. In case no specific values are set out in the ITS on reporting for a given \\nproduct for fields 2.117 and 2.118 (e.g. for the category ‘Multi Commodity Exotic’),\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

Where the segment MIC does not exist, they should \\nuse the operating MIC.  \\n530. The counterparties should use the MIC code \\'XOFF\\' for financial instruments \\nadmitted to trading or traded on a trading venue or for which a request for admission \\nwas made, where the derivative on that financial instrument is not executed on a \\ntrading venue, SI o r organised trading platform outside of the Union, or where a \\ncounterparty does not know it is trading with a counterparty 2 acting as an SI.  \\n \\n \\n \\n184 \\n531.

Table 84 illustrates the population of the reporting fields when a principal \\nexchange takes place, related to a cross -currency swap.  \\n543. In this example, c ounterparties A and B agreed an OTC derivative co ntract, \\nwhich specifies:  \\n- an initial exchange of notional currency in each different currency and the terms \\nof that repayment of notional currency over the life of the swap;  \\n- an exchange of regular payments benchmarked against two interest rates, \\ndenominated  in two different currencies.  \\n544. The counterparty A will pay 5M EUR  and counterparty B will pay 4.3M GBP, as \\ninitial principal exchange for each of them. Counterparties will exchange payments \\neach 6 months for agreed float -to-float 3 -year IRS  \\n545. The re -exchange  of the same notional of currencies will take place at the \\nmaturity date.  \\n546.

Counterparties should report all relevant types of collateral (initial margin, \\nvariation margin and excess collateral), providing both pre - and post -haircut values. \\nEach type of collateral should be reported as a single figure, being the sum of the \\nvalues  of all assets posted/received expressed in a single currency.  \\n548. Collateral can be reported on a portfolio basis. It is up to the reporting \\ncounterparty to determine what unique value to put in the field ‘ Collateral Portfolio \\nCode ’, but this value  should be consistent over the lifetime of the portfolio and not \\nbe re-assigned every day for the same portfolio.

The correct preparation of the Trade State Report (TSR) by TRs is essential to \\nensure the achievement of one of the main objectives of EMIR – the monitoring of \\nsystemic risks to financial stability .  \\n \\n \\n \\n206 \\n553. TRs should include the most up -to-date information relating to outstanding \\nderivatives in the TSR in order to allow the authorities to have a direct and \\nimmediate access to the most granular information  on existing risk exposures \\nbetween counterparties . TRs  should  also allow each individual counterparty to have \\na clear understanding of its own exposures vis -à-vis each market participant with \\nwhich it has an open derivative.  \\n554. The requirements for TRs to pr oduce TSR are included in Article 2 and 5 of the \\nRTS on data access  and Article 4 of the RTS on data quality.  \\n555. In sections  0 and 3.6.2 , ESMA provides clarifications on the allowable \\nsequences of action types and on the allowable combinations between action types \\nand event types . Furthermore, in  section  3.9 ESMA includes guidance with regards \\nto the timeliness of reporting of the conclusion, modification and termination of a \\nderivative.  \\n556. TRs should use the information reported by counterparties, ERRs and RSEs to \\nprepare the TSR. The only instance where the TRs are allowed to update the most \\ncurrent TSR without an action by the aforementioned entities  is detailed in section \\n6.1.7 . \\n557. If a counterparty uses a third party to report their transactions, but the \\ncounterparty submits its valuation reporting itself, it should be possible for all the \\nreporting inf ormation to be amal gamated in the TSR so that all the parties have all \\nthe relevant  information available.  In particular, the TSR provided to the authorities \\nshould contain all the information, including trade, valuation and margin data.  \\n6.1.2  Treatment of event  date \\n558. When constructing the TSR, TRs should  take into account the lifecycle events \\nbased on the logical order derived from the  fields  ‘Event date’ , ’Action type ‘ and \\n’Event type ‘. TRs should update the TSR based on the latest information for a given \\nderivative as derived from the  field ’Event date ‘. In the case of valuation and \\nmargins reports with the same event date, the TRs should also consider the  fields  \\n‘Valuation timestamp’ and ‘Collateral timestamp’, respectively.  \\n559. Where for a given event date  there are several lifecycle  events that affect the \\ndata reported for a given derivative, they should all be included in the latest report \\nfor that event date  and the given action type . TRs should therefore consider the \\nfield ’Reporting timestamp ‘ only with regards to the given  event date .  \\n560. TRs should ensure that derivative contracts that mature on a given day should \\nstill be included in the TSR for that day.  \\n561. The information from previously submitted lifecycle events should in general \\npersist in the TSR when counterparties report subsequent lifecycle events for which \\ncertain fields are not requested to be populated (i.e. not applicable). On the \\ncontrary, TRs should not preserve the previous information in the updated TSR \\nwhen subsequent lifecycle events submit ted by counterparties leave certain \\noptional fields blank. Counterparties should consistently report optional information \\n \\n \\n \\n207 \\nin order to avoid the deletion of available information, which otherwise could lead \\nto reconciliation breaks and missing information i n the latest trade state.  \\n562. TRs should update the state in the past for all outstanding derivatives, whereas \\nfor non -outstanding derivatives TRs should be in a position to update their state for \\nup to ten years following their maturity or termination. This l imit is related to the \\nrequirement under Article 80(3) of EMIR for TRs to keep records of derivatives for \\nat least ten years following their maturity or termination.  \\n563. Updating the state in the past does not imply  that TRs should  reproduce  and \\ndispatch  corrected  historical TSRs on a recurr ent basis  and in an  automated  \\nmanner  every time  late reports or lifecycle events referring to event date s in the \\npast are received . The TSR  produced for a specific date should be considered as \\na snapshot  of all available information at a certain point in time.  However,  it is \\nessential that  TRs’ internal databases should  always  be updated accordingly  when \\nsuch reports are rece ived.  \\n564. TRs should have in place a process for  reproduc ing and dispatch ing corrected  \\nhistorical TSRs based on  ad-hoc requests  made by authorities  or counterparties, \\nRSEs and ERRs . Such TSRs , when reproduced, should  include missing  \\ninformation from late submitted reports and lifecycle events  referring to event dates \\nin the past  which were not included in the original TSR  produced at a specific point \\nin time in the past . TRs should make use of the versioning prefix part of the TRACE \\nfile name convention to distinguish old versions from more recent versions.  \\n565.

From that date onwards, TRs should  therefore use  the full triplet (LEI1 -LEI2-\\nUTI) only to update the state of the derivatives concluded prior to the application \\ndate of the RTS on reporting . To update the state of derivatives concluded after th e \\napplication date of the RTS on reporting , the TRs can use the combination LEI1 -\\nUTI. For simplicity, the TRs can use full triplet in all cases to update the state of the \\nderivative (in cl. derivatives concluded after the application  date of the RTS on \\nreporting). The uniqueness of the newly reported UTIs should be  ensured by the \\ncounterparties and ERR s when reporting and by the TRs when verifying the reports \\nin accordance with the valid ation rules.\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

This will reduce the amount of data provided to autho rities and would \\nfacilitate the immediate assessment of exposures.  \\n582. TRs should use the date fields referring to the effective date  and end date of the \\ninformation contain ed in the schedule to determine  which data point to include in \\nthe TSR. For example, a schedule with the following characteristics is reported: \\n‘value ’ {100, 150, 200}, ‘effective date ’ {T, T+10, T+20}, ‘end date ’ {T+9, T+ 19, \\nT+29}. The TSR s generated for reporting dates T to T+9 should display  the value \\n100, the TSR s generated for  reporting dates  T+10 to T+ 19 should display the value \\n150, and finally, the TSR s generated for  reporting dates  T+20 to T+29 should \\ndisplay the value 200.   \\n583. For fields 2.73-2.78, referring to other payments, TRs should include in the TSR \\nall relevant payments . Payments  of different types  should not be overwritten . This \\nmeans that if a counterparty reports the same payment type more than one time  (in \\ndifferent reports) , the TSR should update such value.

The RTS and the ITS on reporting detail the requirements for reporting of \\nnotional schedules and other payments.  \\n581. TRs should include in  the TSR  only the current  value from the schedule s \\nreported , as opposed to including all the values  from the schedule s. This should be \\napplied  for the following  schedule  fields: 2.50 -2.52 ( ‘Price ’), 2.57 -2.59 ( ‘Notional \\namount of leg 1 ’), 2.61 -2.63 ( ‘Notional quantity of leg 1 ’), 2.66 -2.68 ( ‘Notional \\namount of leg 2 ’), 2.70 -2.72 ( ‘Notional quantity of leg 2 ’), and 2.135 -2.137 ( ‘Strike \\nprice ’). This will reduce the amount of data provided to autho rities and would \\nfacilitate the immediate assessment of exposures.  \\n582. TRs should use the date fields referring to the effective date  and end date of the \\ninformation contain ed in the schedule to determine  which data point to include in \\nthe TSR. For example, a schedule with the following characteristics is reported: \\n‘value ’ {100, 150, 200}, ‘effective date ’ {T, T+10, T+20}, ‘end date ’ {T+9, T+ 19, \\nT+29}. The TSR s generated for reporting dates T to T+9 should display  the value \\n100, the TSR s generated for  reporting dates  T+10 to T+ 19 should display the value \\n150, and finally, the TSR s generated for  reporting dates  T+20 to T+29 should \\ndisplay the value 200.   \\n583. For fields 2.73-2.78, referring to other payments, TRs should include in the TSR \\nall relevant payments . Payments  of different types  should not be overwritten . This \\nmeans that if a counterparty reports the same payment type more than one time  (in \\ndifferent reports) , the TSR should update such value. Below example illustrates the \\nlogic:  \\n \\nEvent date  CP reports  TSR for that day  \\nT UFRO, 100  UFRO, 100  \\nT+1 PEXH, 150; PEXH, \\n200 UFRO, 100; PEXH, 150; PEXH, 200  \\nT+2 PEXH, 250; PEXH, \\n300 UFRO, 100; PEXH, 250; PEXH, 300  \\nT+3 UWIN, 50  UFRO, 100; PEXH, 250; PEXH, 300 ; UWIN, 50  \\n \\n584. For fields 2.122 -2.131, referring to commodities, TRs should include all the \\ninformation as it is reported by counterparties.  \\n585. The most up -to-date linking IDs should persist in the TSR when a counterparty \\nreports a lifecycle event where these fields are not applicable. On the contrary, the \\nlinking IDs should not persist in the TSR when a counterparty reports a lifecycle \\nevent wher e these fields are optional  and reported as blank.  The same approach \\nshould apply also to fields like ‘Event type ’. \\n \\n \\n \\n216 \\n6.1.7  Dead derivatives  \\n586. Where a counterparty ceases to exist, without being acquired or merged, no \\nderivatives should remain outstanding at the tra de repository.  \\n587. If the reporting counterparty reports directly to the TR and notifies the TR in \\norder to cancel its membership, the TR should liaise with the reporting counterparty \\nto terminate the relevant derivatives, while it is still active, by submitt ing reports with \\naction types ‘TERM‘  where the termination date is at the latest the date of the \\ndissolution of the reporting counterparty.  \\n588. If the reporting counterparty does not report directly to the TR, and the ERR or \\nRSE notifies the TR, the TR should liaise with that entity so that the ERR or RSE \\nterminate s the relevant derivatives, while the reporting counterparty is still active, \\nby sub mitting reports with action types ‘TERM ’ where the termination date is at the \\nlatest the date of the dissolution of the reporting counterparty.  \\n589. Where the reporting counterparty has ceased to exist and has not terminated \\nthe outstanding derivatives  and the TR becomes aware of this situation , the \\nfollowing waterfall should be followed:  \\na. If the ERR is different from the reporting counterparty and that ERR has not \\nused RSE, the TR should contact the ERR, should request the submission of \\nreports with action type s ‘TERM  where the termination date is at the latest the \\ndate of the dissolution of the reporting counterparty and, simultaneously, should \\nraise the issue to the NCA of the reporting counterparty. If the reporting \\ncounterparty or the ERR has used a RSE and that entity is still an active RSE \\nat the TR, the TR should contact the RSE, should request the submission of \\nreports with action types ‘TERM ’ where the termination date is at the latest the \\ndate of the dissolution of the reporting counterparty and, simult aneously, should \\nraise the issue to the NCA of the reporting counterparty . \\nb. If the previous step  in point a  is not applicable, the TR should assess the \\nmaturity date of the outstanding derivatives that should be terminated to assess \\nwhether they would natur ally expire in the following twelve months. If that is the \\ncase, no further action should be undertaken by the TR . This is to alleviate the \\nwork of TRs and minimise the risks associated with the process of excluding \\ndead derivatives . \\nc. If the previous  step in point b is not applicable, the TR should contact the other \\ncounterparty/ies to the outstanding derivatives, where those entities report \\ndirectly to the TR, and request them to terminate the outstanding derivatives on \\nbehalf of the reporting counterparty while, if possible, raise the issue to the \\nNCA(s) to follow -up with the other counterparty/ies .  \\nd. Finally, in case none of the above is applicable, the TR, upon confirming with \\nthe NCA and notifying ESMA, should flag the relevant derivatives accordingly \\nand not take them into consideration for the purposes of TSR, reconciliation \\nprocess  or any subsequen t aggregations  such as position reports .\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.

TRs should therefore reconcile , both position -level and trade -level reports , as \\ndetermined by the latest applicable event date, which should be  two working days \\nbefore the date on which the reconciliation takes place. For instance, in case the \\nreconciliation takes place on Wednesdays , TRs should include the derivatives \\nreported wh ose event date is Monday or earlier. In case the reconciliation takes \\nplace on Monday, the TRs should include the derivatives whose event date is \\nThursday or earlier. TARGET 2 calendar should be used to determine working \\ndays.  \\n \\n \\n \\n218 \\n \\nTable 89– Information flow asymmetries between the reconciliation process performed \\nwith a 2-day lag and the TSR  \\nBusiness \\nday Event \\ndate Events  \\nT T • Counterparties 1 and 2 execute a new derivative contract on \\nevent date T  \\n• Counterparty 1 sends the report to the TR on business day T  \\nT+1 T+1 • Counterparty 2 sends the report to the TR on business day  \\nT+1 \\n• TSR delivered on business day  T+1 by 06.00 UTC  to \\nentities  / 12.00 UTC to authorities include the latest state of \\nreported derivatives on business day T  with event date T -1 or \\nearlier, i.e. above derivative is  not included.   \\n• Reconciliation  report  delivered on business day T+ 1 by \\n06.00 UTC  to entities  / 12.00 UTC to authorities  for event \\ndate T -2 or earlier does not include the above derivative  \\n• Reconciliation process runs until midnight UTC for reported \\nderivatives during business day T  or earlier with event date \\nT-1 or earlier.  \\nT+2 T+2 596.

The reconciliation of valuation from trade -level or position -level perspective \\nshould follow the guidance provided in section 6.2.2 . \\n599. When one of th e counterparties  to the derivative is an NFC -, that entity is not \\nrequired to report valuation data . Even if an entity not obliged to report valuation \\ninformation does so, TRs should omit such information  from the reconciliation  \\nprocess.  \\n600. When both counterparties have an obligation to report valuations, TRs should \\ninclude all th e relevant valuation data in the reconciliation  process and flag the \\nderivatives where one of th e counterparties have not repo rted valuation  or where \\nthere are recon ciliation breaks  between the information  as not reconciled.  \\n601. Please refer to section 6.3.3  on the interplay of the reconciliation  of valuation \\nstatus w ith the reconciliation  status of th e derivative.    \\n6.2.4  Derivatives with two legs  \\n1. TRs should reconcile derivatives with two legs by reconciling each of the \\nlegs as reported by the counterparties.  \\n602. It is worth noting that in the case of most type s of derivatives with two legs such \\nas interest -rate swaps, cross -currency swaps and FX swaps, the order of the legs \\ncannot be unequivocally defined, as there is no specific prevalence of one leg over \\nthe other. Therefore, w hen counterparties report inconsi stently the two legs of the \\nderivative, the TR should intend matching the two legs irrespective of the sequence , \\ntaking into account  the values reported by the two counterparties under field \\n‘Direction of leg 1 ’ by matching the leg s with opposite values. I n case counterparty \\n1 has reported it with ‘payer ’ the TR should reconcile it with the leg that is identified \\nas ‘receiver ’ or with the leg that is not identified, when leg 1 is identified with ‘payer ’. \\n603. When a n outstanding  position is the result  of netting  of a position to zero (Level \\n= P and Quantity=0), TR should exclude from the reconciliation the fields ‘Direction ’, \\n‘Direction of leg 1 ’ and ‘Direction of leg 2 ’.  \\n6.2.5  Reconciliation of schedule information  \\n604. TRs should  only reconcile the data on schedule fields  that are included in the \\nTSR. This appr oach is aligned with the one described in section 6.1.6  Inclusion in \\nthe TSR  of sched ule information . \\n \\n \\n \\n220 \\n6.3 Data Quality  feedback  \\n6.3.1  Rejection feedback  \\n605. Article 1(1) of the RTS on data quality requires the TRs  to verify the data they \\nreceive from the report submitting entities upon their reception. In accordance wi th \\nArticle 1(3) of the RTS on data quality TRs shall provide the RSEs with detailed \\ninformation on the results of the data verification. This immediate rejection feedback \\nshall be provided to the relevant RSE within 60 minutes from the reception of the \\ndata, i.e. from the moment the su bmitted file enters the system of the TR . \\n606. Apart from the provision of immediate rejection response to the RSE, the TR \\ncan provide this feedback also to the reporting counterparties and entities \\nresponsible for reporting if those have access  to the TR and t hey express interest \\nto receive the immediate rejection response.  \\n607. Article 1(1) of the RTS on data quality provides a list of specific verification \\nchecks which should be executed by the TRs. Authentication according to Article \\n1(1)(a) should be performed u pfront, therefore no specific rejection feedback should \\nbe provided with respect to this first verification step. The remaining verification \\nchecks should be performed at the point of submission and result in rejection \\nfeedback in accordance with the follo wing rejection categories:  \\na. Schema validation of a submission as per Article 1(1)(b);  \\nb. Authorization / permission of a report submitting entity as per Article 1(1)(c);  \\nc. Logical validation of a submission as per Articles 1(1)(d) to 1(1)(k);  \\nd. Business rules or c ontent validation of a submission as per Article 1(1)(l), as \\nclarified by these Guidelines.  \\n608. Under Article 1(2) of the RTS on data quality a TR shall “reject a derivative report \\nthat does not comply with one of the requirements set out in paragraph 1 and a ssign \\nto it one of the rejection categories” mentioned above.  \\n609. To implement these verification checks TRs should apply validation rules to \\nensure that reporting is performed according to the EMIR regime, including the \\nspecifications of the technical standar ds, as clar ified by these Guidelines. \\nAccordingly, reporting counterparties or submitting entities should comply with the \\nreporting requirements specified by the validation rules which are published \\ntogether with these Guidelines on ESMA’s website.  \\n610. To keep  the technical aspects of the data quality requirements relevant and \\ncorrectly applied, ESMA updates the validation rules when necessary or \\nappropriate. When the validation rules are updated, ESMA specifies the effective \\nday of application of the updated validation rules and the TR s should ensure that \\nthey implement the changes in the specified timeframe and start performing the \\nverification checks with the updated validation rules on the designated date of \\napplication.  \\n \\n \\n \\n221 \\n611. Similarly the reporting counterparties, ERR s or RSE s as applic able should \\nupdate their reporting systems so that the submitted reports are compliant with the \\nnew validation rules on the designated date of application.  \\n612. The validation rules contain a specific error code  and error message  containing  \\nan xml path for eac h of the validation rules and the TRs should use these error \\ncodes  and messages  to specify the rejection reason when communicating \\nrejections to the relevant parties. When a derivative  report  is rejected, the rejection \\nresponse should contain all the error  codes of the validation rules that the submitted \\nderivative  report failed. Therefore, the information on the error codes should be \\nprovided at report level.   \\n613. If the submitted report is correct and compliant with all the reporting \\nrequirements, and with th e technical specifications in the validation rules, the \\nfeedback should indicate that the derivative  report was accepted.  \\n614. The TR should verify compliance of the file with the XML schema (syntax of the \\nwhole file and specific derivative reports). If the fil e is not compliant, the whole file \\n(all derivative s included in the file) is rejected, and the reason will be that the file is \\n‘corrupted ’. In the statistics this should be reported as 1 file rejection even if the file \\ncontradicts the XML schema in multipl e instances.  \\n615. If, however,  the file is compliant with the XML schema and contains e.g. 3 \\nderivative s, but all the derivatives  fail validations, the statistics  should  show the file \\nas accepted with 3 rejected and 0 accepted derivatives . \\n616. Following the receipt  of an immediate rejection  response , to ensure their \\ncompl iance with the reporting obligation under Article 9 of EMIR, the reporting \\ncounterparties or ERR should, either directly or through a RSE,  submit correct and \\ncomplete reports by the reporting timeli ne. \\n617. Further to the immediate rejection feedback, Article 4(1)(c) of the RTS on data \\nquality requires the TRs to make available to the reporting counterparties, RSEs, \\nERRs and third parties which have been granted an access to EMIR data under \\nArticle 78(7) of EMIR end -of-day reports of derivatives that have been rejected \\nduring that day. As specified in the RTS  on data quality , this report shall be made \\naccessible by 6:00 UTC to entities and 12.00 UTC to authorities  on the following \\nworking day.  For the dete rmination of working days TARGET 2 calendar should be \\nused.  \\n618. The TRs should use all the data they have collected to determine what \\ninformation they should provide and to which RSEs, ERRs and counterparties. \\nInformation on errors pertaining to the whole file  should be made available to the \\nRSE of the file and to all ERRs and counterparties populated in fields 1.3 and 1.4 \\nin that rejected file as applicable, assuming it is possible to read the information \\nfrom the rejected file. Information on errors pertainin g to a specific record should \\nbe made available to the RSE, ERR and counterparty 1 populated in this record to \\nthe extent the entities  are on -boarded . \\n619. Regarding the deadlines for provision of (immediate and end -of-day) rejection \\nresponse under special circumstances, such as scheduled or non -scheduled \\n \\n \\n \\n222 \\nmaintenance, the TRs should proceed analogously to the existing guidance on \\noperational aspects on data a ccess , as detailed in section 6.4.1 . \\n6.3.1.1  Immediate rejection feedback  \\n620. Immediate rejection response shall according to Article 1(3) of the RTS on data \\nquality be provided by the TRs in the standardized response messages compliant \\nwith ISO 20022 format, specifically the XSD schema . It should contain the following \\ninformation:  \\nTable 90 - Immediate rejection feedback  \\nNo. Field  Details to be reported  XML Message  \\n1 File identification  Textual value  … \\n<RjctnSttstcs > \\n <CtrPtyId>  \\n  <RptgCtrPrty>  \\n   <LEI>12345678901234500000 </LEI> \\n  </RptgCtrPrty>  \\n  <RptSubmitgNtty > \\n   <LEI>12345678901234500000 </LEI> \\n  </RptSubmitgNtty > \\n  <NttyRspnsblForRpt > \\n   <LEI>12345678901234500000 </LEI> \\n  </NttyRspnsblForRpt > \\n </CtrPtyId>  \\n <RptSttstcs>  \\n  <TtlNbOfRpts>1</TtlNbOfRpts>  \\n  <TtlNbOfRptsAccptd >1 \\n  </TtlNbOfRptsAccptd > \\n  <TtlNbOfRpts Rjctd>0 \\n  </TtlNbOfRpts Rjctd> \\n </RptSttstcs>  \\n <DerivSttstcs>  \\n  <DtldSttstcs>  \\n   <TtlNbOfTxs> 10 \\n   </TtlNbOfTxs>  \\n   <TtlNbOfTxsAccptd> 9 \\n   </TtlNbOfTxsAccptd>  \\n   <TtlNbOfTxsRjctd> 1 \\n   </TtlNbOfTxsRjctd>  \\n   <TxsRjctnsRsn>  \\n   <TxId> \\n    <ActnTp>NEWT</ActnTp>   \\n    <RptgTmStmp > \\n    2025-0407T10:00:00Z  \\n    </RptgTmStmp > \\n    <DerivEvtTp >TRAD \\n    </DerivEvtTp > \\n    <EvtTmStmp><Dt>  \\n    2025-04-07 \\n    </Dt></EvtTmStmp > \\n    <OthrCtrPty>  \\n      <Lgl><LEI>  2 Rejection reason  Error code  \\n3 Rejection description  Error description  \\n4 Number of derivatives  \\nreceived  10 \\n5 Number  of derivatives  \\naccepted  9 \\n6 Number  of derivatives  \\nrejected  1 \\n7 Identification of the \\nderivatives   \\n8 Counterparty 1 ( Reporting \\ncounterparty ) 123456789012345  \\n00000  \\n9 Counterparty  2 ABCDEFGHIJKLM  \\nNOPQRST  \\n10 UTI  UTI1  \\n11 Reporting timestamp  2025 -04-07T10:00:00Z  \\n12 Event date  2025 -04-07 \\n13 Event type  TRAD  \\n14 Action type  NEWT  \\n15 Status Accepted  ACPT  \\n16 Status Rejected  RJCT  \\n17 Rejection reason  EMIR -VR-1001 -6 \\n \\n \\n \\n223 \\n \\n621.

End-of-day rejection report should be provided electronically in ISO 20022 XML \\nmessage. TRs could , in addition,  use another interface so that e.g. in case the \\nreporting counterparty or the entity responsible for reporting are not reporting \\ndirectly to the TR, but have a view only account, will be able to have detailed \\nunderstanding on their compliance with the reporting obligation under EMIR.  \\n6.3.2  Warnings feedback  \\n625. Article 4(1)(e) to 4(1)(g) of the RTS on data quality requires the TRs to make \\navailable to the reporting counterparties, RSEs, ERRs and third pa rties which have \\nbeen granted an access to EMIR data under Article 78(7) of EMIR end -of-day \\nreports on missing valuations of outstanding derivatives, missing margin \\ninformation of outstanding derivatives, as well as on abnormal values reported in \\nthe field s. \\n626.

For the determination of \\nworking days TARGET 2 calendar should be used.   \\n627. The TRs should use all the data they have co llected to determine what \\ninformation they should provide and to which RSEs, ERRs and counterparties.  \\n628. The inclusion of derivatives into the end -of-day warning s feedback  reports for \\nmissing valuations and margin information  should follow the same rules as t he \\ninclusion of derivatives into the Trade State Report as described in detail in section  Table 91 - End-of-day rejection report  \\nNo. Field  Details to be \\nreported  XML Message  \\n    </TxsRjctnsRsn>  \\n   </DtldSttstcs>  \\n… \\n14 Reporting timestamp  2025 -04-\\n07T10:00:00Z   \\n15 Event date  2025 -04-07  \\n16 Event type  TRAD   \\n17 Action type  NEWT   \\n18 Status Accepted  ACPT   \\n19 Status Rejected  RJCT   \\n20 Rejection reason  EMIR -VR-1001 -6  \\n21 Rejection description  Xpath of the \\nerroneous  field  \\n \\n \\n \\n226 \\n6.1. Therefore, the warnings should be provided on the basis of TSR and for \\nexample dead derivatives should be excluded (as exp lained in section  6.1.7 ).  \\n629. The inclusion of derivatives into the end -of-day warning s feedback report for \\nabnormal values should instead be based on the TAR, where reports received with \\naction type ‘New’, ‘Position component ’, ‘Modif y’ or ‘Correct ’ should be used for this \\npurpose.  \\n630. The number of derivatives included in the warning s feedbac k reports should be \\nassessed from the viewpoint of counterparty 1.  \\n631. End-of-day warning s feedback reports on missing valuations and margin \\ninformation should exclude records pertaining to counterparties who are not obliged \\nto submit daily valuations and marg in information on outstanding derivatives. The \\nidentification of these out -of-scope records should be achieved by filtering field 1.5 \\n‘Nature of counterparty 1 ’ = ‘N’ and field 1.7 ‘Clearing threshold of counterparty 1 ’ \\n= ‘False’. Moreover, the warning s feedback report on missing margin information \\nshould exclude uncollateralized trades . The identification of the out -of-scope \\nuncollateralized records should be achieved by filtering field 3.11 ‘Collateralisation \\ncategory ’ = ‘UNCL ’. \\n632. The TRs should provide the relevant data in scope for the warning s feedback \\nreports to the relevant RSEs, and to all ERRs and counterparties as applicable.  \\n633. End-of-day reports providing information on missing or abnormal data do not \\nentail rejection of derivative reports , they are of informative nature and should \\nprovide warnings on possible faults in reporting to the relevant parties. \\nNevertheless, despite the informative nature, the reporting counterparties, ERRs \\nand RSEs as applicable should always investigate the iden tified issues and if \\nmisreporting is confirmed the data should be corrected or missing data reported \\nwithout undue delay.  \\n634. Regarding the deadlines for provision of end -of-day warning s feedback  reports \\nunder special circumstances, such as scheduled or non -scheduled maintenance, \\nthe TRs should proceed analogously to the existing guidance on operational \\naspects on data access  included under section 6.4.1 . \\n635. End-of-day warn ings feedback  reports should be provided electronically in the \\nstandardized response messages compliant with ISO 20022 format. TRs could , in \\naddition,  use another interface so that e.g. in case the reporting counterparty or the \\nentity responsible for repor ting are not reporting directly to the TR, but have a view \\nonly account, will be able to have detailed understanding on their compliance with \\nthe reporting obligation under EMIR Refit.  \\n6.3.2.1  Missing valuations report  \\n636. According to Article 4(1)(e) of the RTS on da ta quality the outstanding \\nderivatives for which no valuation has been reported, or the valuation that was \\nreported is dated more than fourteen calendar days earlier than the day for which \\nthe report is generated shall be included in the end -of-day missing  valuations \\n \\n \\n \\n227 \\nreport. To provide the missing valuations feedback the TRs should use as reference \\nthe TSR generated in accordance with section 6.1.  \\n637.

A derivative report should be included into the warnings feedback report when \\nat least one of the listed fields was populated with an abnormal value. If the \\nderivative report contains abnormal values for more than one field, all of these \\nabnormal values should be indicated in the feedback.  \\n646. The values of these fields should be converted into the EUR equivalent amounts \\nfor the pu rpose of abnormal values detection.  \\n647.

To ensure compliance with Article 4(1)(g) of the RTS on data quality, the TR \\nshould inform ESMA on the outlier detection method chosen and the thresholds \\napplied for that particular method.  \\n649. The TR should also make the information on outlier detection meth od and \\nthresholds available to the relevant entities receiving end -of-day abnormal values \\nreports, so that they are fully informed about the content of these reports.  \\n650.

The category ‘Reporting requirement for both counterparties ’ should be filled by \\nthe TR based on the information in field 1.14. Where the field is populated ‘True’, \\nthen the status of the reconciliation category should be ‘Yes’, otherwise it should \\nbe ‘No’. \\n653. The category ‘Reporting type ’ should be populated with ‘Single-sided ’ when the \\nTR has received only one side of the derivatives, and ‘Dual-sided ’ when both \\ncounterparties have reported to the same TR.  \\n654. The category ‘Pairing ’ should be populated with ‘Paired ’ when the TR has been \\nable to identify the two sides of the same derivative or ‘Unpaired ’ when  it has not \\nyet been able to do so. When a TR identifies a derivative as ‘Dual-sided ’ in the \\ncategory ‘Reporting type ’, it should only identify it as ‘Paired ’ in the category \\n‘Pairing ’. \\n655. Only derivatives that have been paired can be reconciled. Therefore status of \\n‘Reconciled ’ for either the category ’Reconciliation ‘ or the category ‘Valuation \\nreconciliation ’ should only be assigned by the TR for derivatives that are  ‘Paired ’.  \\n656. The TRs should take into account that valuation updates for ETD trades are \\nreported at position level and that NFC- are not obliged to submit valuation updates \\nfor their derivatives. These cases should be flagged in the schema as ‘Not \\napplicabl e’ as opposed to categorising them as ‘Not reconciled ’. \\n657. The TRs should identify as ‘Reconciled ’ only those derivatives for which all the \\nreconcilable fields are within the allowed tolerances of reconciliation.  \\n658. Finally, the population of the categories ‘Revived ’ and ‘Further modifications ’ is \\nindependent from the rest of reconciliation categories.  Category  ‘Further \\nmodifications ’ should be set to ‘Yes’ when a lifecycle event other than ‘NEWT ’ is \\nreceived, and this value should be kept until the updated derivative contract is \\nreconciled . Category  ‘Revive ’ should be set to ‘Yes’ when a lifecycle event ‘REVI ’ \\nis received, and this value should be kept until the deriva tive contract is no longer \\noutstanding.  \\n659. In the table included below all the allowable combinations are included. TRs \\nshould only use the below combinations when providing reconciliation feed back.  \\n \\n \\n \\n234 \\n \\nTable 96 \\nReporting \\nrequirement \\nfor both \\ncounterparties  Reporting \\ntype Pairing  Reconciliation Valuation \\nreconciliation* Revived  Further \\nmodifications  \\nNo Single -sided  Unpaired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  No No \\nNo Single -sided  Unpaired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes No \\nNo Single -sided  Unpaired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  No Yes \\nNo Single -sided  Unpaired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Unpaired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  No No \\nYes Single -sided  Unpaired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes No \\nYes Single -sided  Unpaired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  No Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Unpaired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  No No \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes No \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  No Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Reconciled  Not reconciled  No No \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes No \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Reconciled  Not reconciled  No Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Reconciled  Reconciled  No No \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Reconciled  Reconciled  Yes No \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Reconciled  Reconciled  No Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Reconciled  Reconciled  Yes Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Reconciled  No No \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Reconciled  Yes No \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Reconciled  No Yes \\nYes Single -sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Reconciled  Yes Yes \\nYes Dual-sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  No No \\nYes Dual-sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes No \\nYes Dual-sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  No Yes \\nYes Dual-sided  Paired  Not reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes Yes \\nYes Dual-sided  Paired  Reconciled  Not reconciled  No No \\nYes Dual-sided  Paired  Reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes No \\nYes Dual-sided  Paired  Reconciled  Not reconciled  No Yes \\nYes Dual-sided  Paired  Reconciled  Not reconciled  Yes Yes \\n \\n \\n \\n235 \\n \\n6.3.3.1  Immediate feedback  \\n660.

When providing end-of-day reconciliation information included in Article 4(1)(d) \\nof the RTS on data quality, the TR should provide information about all derivatives \\nthat are in the scope of the reconciliation process .  \\n6.4 Data access  \\n6.4.1  Operational aspects  \\n663. When providing access to transaction  data in accordance with Article 2 of the \\nRTS on data access , TRs should include all details  of deri vatives , irrespective of \\nwhether the report for a derivative has been accepted or rejected by the TR . Further \\nclarifications to the requirement in the RTS on data access are provided in the \\nbelow paragraphs.  \\n664. A Union competent authority (including the comp etent authorities of the EU \\nMember States) has access to all transaction data on all derivatives concluded by \\na counterparty that fall within the scope of that authority, where such counterparty \\n \\n \\n \\n237 \\nis reported under field 1.4 ‘Counterparty 1 (reporting counte rparty  )’ or field 1.9 \\n‘Counterparty  2’). \\n665. A competent authority from a Member State has access to all transaction data \\non all derivatives concluded by a counterparty that is from the same Member State, \\nwhere these competent authorities should be provided w ith access to data in \\naccordance with Article 81(3) of EMIR.  \\n666. Union securities and market authorities , as referred to in Article 81(3)(j) of EMIR,  \\nshould be given access to all transaction data on derivatives when it is the Relevant \\nCompetent Authority (RCA) according to FIRDS  either in relation to the deri vative \\nitself ( field 2.7 ) or the underlying ( field 2.14 ). Considering that the RCA may change \\nover time, trade repositories are expected to provide access to the authority \\ndesignated as RCA at the time the report is generated.  \\n667. Union securities and market  authorities , as referred to in Article 81(3)(j) of EMIR,  \\nshould be given access to all transact ion data on derivatives whe re the field  \\n‘Underlying identification type’ (field 2.13 ) is reported with an ‘X’ or a ‘B’ and the \\nfield ‘Underlying identification ’ (field 2.14 ) is populated with either:   \\na. ISIN of the underlying index or an ISIN belonging to a ny of the individual \\ncomponents of the underlying basket, whose first two letters represent the \\ncountry code of that competent authority, or  an ISIN belonging to any of the \\nindividual components of the underlying basket, where the Relevant Competent \\nAuthority (RCA) as determined in the FIRDS database is that competent \\nauthority, or  \\nb. ISIN of the underlying index or an ISIN belonging to any of the i ndividual \\ncomponents of the underlying basket of indices, whose first two letters do not \\nrepresent the country code of that competent authority, however is needed for \\nthat authority in order to perform its responsibilities and mandates, or  \\nc. full names (assi gned by index providers) or standardised 4 -letter codes of \\nadditional indices that, though not identified by ISIN, are needed for that \\nauthority in order to perform its responsibilities and mandates.  \\n668. In that regard, each competent authority can provide ESM A with an up to date \\nlist of the ISINs and/or full names (assigned by index providers) of additional indices \\nand/or indicator s of the underlying  index for which that authority also requires \\naccess to transaction data if a given index is identified in the r eport as the underlying \\nindex or a component of the underlying basket or a list with principles, e.g. \\nderivatives referring to stock issued in a member state if a detailed list of derivative \\ntypes or underlyings is not feasible and might result in an undue  restriction of data \\naccess. That list should be maintained by ESMA, based on the information provided \\nby the authorities, and made available to Trade Repositories. The TRs should filter \\nthe list of indices without taking into account case -sensitive ness of  the reported \\ncharacters .  \\n669. From the perspective of providing access based on the UPI, the TRs should \\nmake use of the available information published by ANNA -DSB.  \\n \\n \\n \\n238 \\n670. The TRs should establish the data access of the third country authorities in \\naccordance with Article 3 of the RTS on data access.  \\n671. Articles 5(7) and 5(8) of the RTS on data access, do not refer to the timelines \\nthat trade repositories should follow in the event of carrying out scheduled \\nmaintenance that impacts TR services related to authorities’ a ccess to data, \\nirrespective of the channel or format used.  \\n672. Trade repositories should plan carefully the scheduled maintenance that \\nimpacts TR services related to authorities’ access to data so that it does not \\ncoincide with working days determined in accor dance with a calendar consistently \\nagreed in the Union such as the TARGET 2  calendar. Where under exceptional \\ncircumstances it coincides with such a working day, the scheduled maintenance \\nshould be carried out outside normal working hours, i.e. very early in the morning \\nor very late at night. The trade repositories should make sure that the \\naforementioned scheduled maintenance is  not performed in a way that circumvents \\nthe timely availability of derivatives information to authorities.  \\n673. Trade repositories sho uld use electronic means to notify all authorities of the \\nstart and end dates and times of their scheduled maintenance as fast as technically \\npossible.  \\n674. Where an annual planning of scheduled maintenance windows that impact TR \\nservices related to authorities ’ access to data exists at the TR, the TR should notify \\nall authorities of that planning on an annual basis and with at least three working \\ndays’ notice. Furthermore, any additional specific notifications on scheduled \\nmaintenance that impact TR services re lated to authorities’ access to data, that are \\nnot notified on an annual basis, should be made at the earliest opportunity and at \\nleast three working days before the starting date of the scheduled maintenance that \\nimpacts TR services related to authorities ’ access to data.  \\n675. Trade repositories should keep a record of the relevant notifications that can be \\nmade available to ESMA upon request. The records related to scheduled \\nmaintenance notifications should contain, at least, the following information: the \\ntimestamp of the notification, the start and the end of the scheduled maintenance \\nthat impacts TR services related to authorities’ access to data and the relevant list \\nof users notified.  \\n676. In the case of verification of requests under Article 5(8) of the RTS on  data \\naccess,  trade repositories should confirm receipt and verify the correctness and \\ncompleteness of any request to access data, at the earliest opportunity and no later \\nthan sixty minutes after the finalisation of the relevant scheduled maintenance that  \\nimpacts TR services related to authorities’ access to data.  \\n677. In the case of non -scheduled maintenance, the trade repositories should meet \\nthe timelines included in Articles 5(7) and 5(8) of the RTS on data access  and these \\ntimelines will be taken as refere nce when assessing the compliance of the trade \\nrepository.  \\n \\n \\n \\n239 \\n678. Trade repositories should notify ESMA and the entities listed in Article 81(3) of \\nEMIR that have access to data at that TR of the non -scheduled maintenance in \\naccordance with their procedures.    \\n6.4.2  Template form for data access  \\n679. TRs should use the following template, presented across the below subsections \\nto set up the access  to derivatives data pursuant to Article 4 of the RTS on data \\naccess.  \\n680. As positions and tasks may change, an entity listed in Ar ticle 81(3) of EMIR \\nshould only lay down its mandate, but not any information regarding their internal \\norganisation.  \\n681. TRs should ensure regular review of data access for authorities, on an ongoing \\nbasis as soon as they become aware of a change and at least once per year and \\nshould update the data access in accordance with the same timeline for the initial \\nset up of access as per Article 4 (1) of the RTS on data access . \\n682. As per Article 4 (1) (d) of the RTS on data access, TRs should set up access to \\ndetails of transaction data on derivatives for the entities listed in Article 81(3) of \\nEMIR  based on the information provided in the form referred to in the Article  4(2) \\nof the RTS on data access . It is therefore important that the information provided in \\nthe form is as accurate and complete as possible and to this end TRs are expected \\nto proactively engage with the authorities . In particular, if a TR , based on the \\ninformation it has collected and analyzed, believes that there are errors or \\nomissions in the form (for instance, a specific mandate has not been ticked by an \\nauthority), the TR should contact the authority and confirm the scope of its mandate , \\nas soon as feasible and with a view to ensure the provision of access as per the \\ntimeline set out in Article 4(1)  (f) of the RTS on data access . TRs should make use \\nof publicly available data, for instance ESMA registers for CCP and trading venues, \\nto confirm the information included by Authorities in the data access form as well \\nas to monitor any potential update s to their mandates.  \\n683. For the provision of access to authorities under Article 81(3) (f)  of EMIR TRs \\nshould be provided by each authority with the list of MIC codes under its supervision \\nin the access form.  \\n684. The list of EMIR fields to be used by TRs f or filtering data for each of the \\nmandates listed in Article 81(3) of EMIR can be found in Table 9 6 below . If at least \\none field contains information  based on which it can be determined that  the \\nauthority is entitled to receive the data, then this data sho uld be made available to \\nthis authority.  \\n685. With regard to calculated position data access, each specific regulatory field \\nshould  be used by TRs to determine which position data should  be made available \\nto authorities, e.g. by currency . To establish the acces s to derivatives reported at \\nposition level, TRs should follow the same rules as for derivatives reported at \\ntransaction level.  \\n \\n \\n \\n240 \\n686. With regard to takeover bids, TRs should  retrieve data related to all the involved \\nparties as e.g. in takeover bids / offers / s ecurities as defined in Article 2 of Directive \\n2004/25/EC.  \\n6.4.2.1  Contact information  \\nTABLE 98 \\nRegulator Information and Authorised signatory   \\nFull name of the entity  (with English translation \\nwhere appropriate)  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nWebsite of the entity listed in Article 81(3) EMIR   Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nAuthorised signatory contact name  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nAuthorised signatory mailing address  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nAuthorised signatory email address  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\n6.4.2.2  Contact details for TR data user (or team) at the entity listed under Article 81(3) \\nEMIR to receive important n otifications  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n241 \\nTABLE 99 \\nContact name  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nEmail address  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nPhone number  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nCredentials for a secure SSH FTP connection  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nTRACE code of the authority  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nKey of the authority  Click or tap here to enter text.  \\nAny other technical information relevant to the \\nentity\\'s access to details of derivatives.

    "1.  Overall Document Summary\n",
    "2.  Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes) with descriptions\n",
    "3.  Key Relationships/Interactions (Edges) with source, target, and nature of relationship\n",

    "   *   **Node Object Attributes:**\n",
    "        *   `\"id\"`: (String) A unique, machine-readable identifier for the node. Generate this by taking the entity/concept name, converting it to lowercase, and replacing spaces with underscores (e.g., \"ESMA Report 2023\" becomes \"esma_report_2023\"). Ensure these IDs are unique.\n",
    "        *   `\"label\"`: (String) The original human-readable name of the entity/concept (e.g., \"ESMA Report 2023\").\n",
    "        *   `\"description\"`: (String) The description of the entity/concept provided in the input summary.\n",
    "        *   `\"type\"`: (String) (Optional, but preferred) Attempt to categorize the entity (e.g., \"Document\", \"Regulation\", \"Organization\", \"Person\", \"Concept\", \"Process\"). If unsure, use a generic type like \"Entity\" or omit.\n",
    "        *   `\"themes\"`: (Array of Strings) A list of the titles of the \"Main Themes/Information Clusters\" from the input summary where this entity/concept was listed as central.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Edges:**\n",
    "   *   The `\"edges\"` value should be an array of objects.\n",
    "   *   Each edge object should represent a relationship or interaction identified in the \"Key Relationships/Interactions\" section of the input summary.\n",
    "   *   **Edge Object Attributes:**\n",
    "        *   `\"source\"`: (String) The `\"id\"` of the source node for this relationship (must match one of the generated node IDs).\n",
    "        *   `\"target\"`: (String) The `\"id\"` of the target node for this relationship (must match one of the generated node IDs).\n",
    "        *   `\"label\"`: (String) The nature of the relationship as described in the input summary (e.g., \"influences\", \"proposes changes to\", \"is part of\").\n",
    "        *   `\"details\"`: (String) (Optional) Any additional context or details provided for the relationship in the input summary.\n",

    "**Processing Guidelines:**\n",
    "*   Carefully map the information from the \"Key Entities/Concepts\" section of the input summary to the node objects.\n",
    "*   Carefully map the information from the \"Key Relationships/Interactions\" section of the input summary to the edge objects, ensuring you use the generated node `\"id\"` values for `\"source\"` and `\"target\"`.\n",
    "*   Use the \"Main Themes/Information Clusters\" section to populate the `\"themes\"` attribute for each node.\n",
    "*   Ensure consistency between the node IDs generated and those used in the source/target fields of the edges.\n",

Moreover, the Central Bank continues to publish bank wide AWPR on a weekly basis \\nto enhance transparency of the published rates. Interest rates applicable on short term loans and \\nadvances granted by LCBs to their prime customers during a week are considered for this \\npurpose.  \\nWith the discontinuation of the Sri Lanka Inter Bank Offered Rate (SLIBOR) from 01 July \\n2020, a Task Force was established with members from banking community and the central \\nBank to review existing benchmarks. As AWPR is considered one of the most appropriate \\nbenchmark interest rates, the Task Force was of the view that it is required to conduct a survey \\nto evaluate whether LCBs adhere to the guidelines, when submitting AWPR returns to the \\ncentral bank. After conducting a survey on reporting methodology adopted by LCBs in \\nreporting AWPR, the Central Bank finds it timely to update the guidelines on reporting AWPR. \\nAccordingly, the guidelines are revised as follows:  \\nGuidelines on reporting transactions for AWPR:  \\n1. The reporting week for AWPR is from Friday to Thursday, and the return should be \\nreported on or before 2:00 PM each Friday via email (money&banking@cbsl.lk) as an \\nexcel worksheet or via Fax (0112387017) in case of any technical difficulty, as per the \\nattached format. If the reporting day is a holiday, the report should be submitted on the \\nprevious working day.  \\n2. Prime Customers are defined as the most creditworthy customers, who are charged \\nrelatively low interest on short term lending. LCBs shall have the discretion of deciding \\ntheir own prime customers based on their internal ratings and risk assessment.  \\n3. Aa LCBs need to maintain a list of their prime customers based on their \\ncreditworthiness, and such list should be reviewed at least quarterly. The Central Bank \\nmay occasionally request banks to submit this list of prime customers.  \\n4. Interest rates and disbursed amounts of the new loans with the ten lowest interest rates \\ngranted to prime customers during the week need to be reported.  \\n5. The decision to consider a given loan under AWPR reporting should be based only on \\nwhether the respective customer is a prime customer, subject to other guidelines \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n        **Instructions:**\\n\\n        Please analyze the document and provide the following information in a structured format:\\n\\n        1.  **Overall Document Summary:**\\n            *   A concise summary (3-5 sentences) that clearly captures the main purpose, core arguments, and overall conclusions of the document.\\n\\n        2.  **Key Entities/Concepts (Nodes):**\\n            *   Identify and list the most important entities, concepts, organizations, individuals, processes, or items discussed.
